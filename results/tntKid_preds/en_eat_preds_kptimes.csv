0	Development of the Rhône and reserved flow. Operations to increase the reserve flows and to restore the by-passed sections of the RHONE River have considerable ecological aims that can however, lead to a loss of renewable energy sources if the economic conditions for building small hydropower plants to harness the additional reserve flows are not satisfied. The only means of economically justifying investments to exploit the energy of additional reserve flows, and thus implement a complete approach consistent with the Kyoto objectives, is to apply adapted prices that take into account, for example, the cost of renewable energy and to call on local external funds (Refer to PIERRE BENITE development); however, these are difficult to raise.	
1	Amenity: quality in the social relationships, qualities of a place. In a context where the word 'amenities' is used in the political realm on one hand, where its attested uses in the scientific realm comes from economics only on the other hand, the paper simply expresses the idea that an acception refering to other human and social sciences is possible for this terminology. After a brief insight into some present authors' words that employ 'amenities', we show that, in the light of some concepts mainly coming from sociology and geography, this acception could refer to the articulation of a sociological dimension and of a spatial dimension, to the articulation of the quality of being together and of the quality of places. We'll discuss a possible line of research for the 'amenities' question as far as it is applied to rural areas, still from the point of view of human and social sciences.	political
2	Amenities, non-market functions and forest management planning. Taking into account non-market functions in forest management becomes a new stake for forest owners and public institutions. The first of them are claiming their rights linked to their responsibilities in counterpart of the new environmental obligations. To address this issue, some definitions and concepts are first reminded: externalities, amenities, and different values for non-market goods and services. Then, the main attributes of these goods and services are related, with a particular attention paid to the application to forest sector: diverse relations between these functions and the production function, accurate scale of analysis wider than the management scale, high substituality between common areas. The conditions allowing to market amenities are then enounced: allocation of property rights, willingness to produce, and modalities of the exchanges between producers and consumers. A sectorial approach is certainly not efficient and this issue must be considered at the territorial level. There is a lack of research in this field, and some scientific concerns are listed.	
3	Relationships with other abiotic and biotic ecosystem elements and functional roles of macrophytes. Macrophytes are studied regarding other compartments of the hydrosystems, so much abiotic (water mass, physical environment), that biotic (epiphytic algae, invertebrates, fish). Macrophytes modify the physical habitat, reducing locally and diversifying the flow, trapping the sediments. They store the nutritive elements temporarily. For the biotic elements, the macrophytes are a support for the micro- and macro-algae of the periphyton, but the detailed relationships between macrophytes and microphytes remain to be elucidated. For invertebrates, the macrophytes are a diversified place of life. But the macrophytes are also a source of food for certain invertebrates, contrary to what was pled until recently. The relations macrophyte-fish are practically not of trophic nature, but are expressed directly in terms of medium of life and source of shelter or indirectly by the modifi cations involved on the physical or physicochemical elements of the habitat. The comparisons between biotypologies by macrophytes and invertebrates, on the one hand, macrophytes and fish, on the other hand, highlight a clear agreement of the determinisms, but also the specific characteristics to each group of organizations, which informs about their respective capacity of bioindication. A reflexion on the trophic networks concludes the matter.	algae;water
4	Linking between different scales of space and time to preserve the landscape: Artense. In the Artense (France's Massif Central), there is a sustainable development plan and a landscape charter, which together are intended to preserve the landscape while ensuring sustainable development. On the basis of a description of the landscape, taken together with the economic, social and ecological factors that produced it, an extensive campaign was undertaken to motivate local councillors and inhabitants, as well as local authorities and organisations that influenced, directly or indirectly, the development of the landscape, to set up a global action programme with grants, regulations and contracts.... These 2 examples set out the framework of what could be a balanced landscape approach, encouraging the development of a social policy balancing socio-economic issues against the characteristics and constraints specific to each environment. They show the need for a balance between various scales of space and time: local (communes or groups of communes) where specific programmes are planned over the medium-term (a few years), regional and national to ensure that the initiatives are compatible with each other, to encourage such initiatives and check that these actions comply with a global policy that must be clear and viable in the long-term, micro-local: (plots of land, local environments) because the actions resulting from these projects are carried out on this scale and in the very short-term (year or even season).	environment;space
5	"Nonmarket benefits from Brest natural harbour preservation. Brest natural harbour was chosen by the European Community as a pilot site in respect to improvements in coastal water quality. The depollution program will be financed by the Community, the French government and regional authorities. there are two problems to be resolved in priority: microbe contamination from urban sources and over enrichment in nutrients from agricultural sources. This paper deals with the non-market value, which local people give to water quality in the harbour. Our objectives are to improve the knowledge about the demand for nautral assets in France, and simultaneously to prepare a cost-benefit analysis, which will help decision-making concerning the restoration of the harbour. In an on site survey carried out in summer 1993, we realised a contigent valuation for two goods: 1) improved water salubrity, and 2) preservation of the ecosystem against eutrophication (under uncertainty). The corresponding WTP's were explained using tobit models. Whatever the good, the WTP was seen to rise with revenue. However, whilst the WTP ""salubrity"" was affected by environmental sensibility and the awareness of local pollution, it is above all education, which affected the WTP ""ecosystem"". On whole, the residents accepted the exercise of contingent valuation and were willing to give important amounts (FF 215 and FF 160 on average per household per year respectively for goods 1 and 2). The behavioural differences between both goods and the significance of the WTP's thus obtained are discussed."	water;france;brest natural;agricultural
6	Assessment of the workings of a pig slurry treatment facility on the farm with phase separation and anaerobic lagooning. An assessement of waste elements from a piggery producing nearly 11000 growing pigs per year and their transformation before landspreading was determined on slurry subjected to centrifugal sieving and storage in an anaerobic lagoon. This effluent contains 3.77, 1.31 and 1.44 kg of N, P and K, respectively and 30 and 76 g of Cu and Zn per growing pig produced. Ammonia volatilization accounts for 28 % of excreted nitrogen: 11 % from the piggery and 17 % from the lagoon. The estimated methane emissions from the lagoon were between 4.9 and 5.9 kg per pig produced. After decantation in the lagoon, 82 % of the rejected P, Cu and Zn, 32 % DCO and 13.8 % of excreted N, can be collected in a manageable sediment after drying on a sand bed. The transformations in the lagoon produce a partially purified liquid that is easier to use than the initial manure. The purifying system can be further improved.	pig
7	Environmental assessement of landfill GHG emission mitigation and landfill gas recovery: a necessary evolution of landfill cover design. Solid Waste landfilling is a common application of Geosynthetics in geo-environmental engineering. Non-hazardous waste Landfills are responsible for Methane emissions, a Greenhouse Gas (GHG) with high Global Warming Potential naturally present in the biogas. An evaluation of Greenhouse Gas emissions from landfills depending on the way they are operated and on the cap cover characteristics (semi-permeable, impermeable) is presented. Energy recovery from biogas is also discussed. The sensitivity of the environmental performance of landfills on the cover characteristics as well as on the biogas collection and recovery system is highlighted.	evolution;greenhouse gas emissions;landfills
8	Natural reforestation and growth of brushwood on the Méjean limestone plateau: the value of a combined approach between natural and social sciences. The spontaneous reforestation of agricultural land is studied from an interdisciplinary point of view involving natural science and social science. Depending on the scale on which the phenomena is studied, various sources and methods for data processing are used. Natural science and social science data are crossed in parallel by multivariable analysis and by the geographical data system (SIG). Various hypotheses explaining the progression of ligneous vegetation are thus tested and arranged by order of importance.	natural;agricultural
9	Design, implementation and operation of sand filters. In a range from 100 to about 1000 People Equivalent (PE), Secondary Wastewater Sand Filters (SWSF) are used by a lot of rural communities in France. A series of case studies however point out that several criteria concerning global and detailed design and implementation of these systems have to be approached scientifically, in order to obtain the expected results on a long-term basis. The choice of the sand constituting the infiltration bed, core of the biological reactor, is of course one of the key elements and is the main subject of this article. It must have a sufficient initial permeability in order to ensure an adapted infiltration speed, after colonisation by the purifying biomass. The d10, fines content mainly and degree of uniformity control this permeability. The quarry or the aggregate extractor, who masters his production this way, usually gives these elements, based on granulometric analysis. However the adjustment of an infiltration test with clear water is essential to check on site the conformity of the deliveries.	filters;france
10	How can the EAFRD support green tourism?. The agricultural population decreases everywhere in Europe. The agricultural sector falls prey to both trends : specialisation towards production devoted to agro industry from large economic size farms, and new activities for the others, in order to develop other agricultural functions. Green tourism, especially tourism on farms, is an opportunity for keeping living countries and for sustainable development. Our contribution aims at analysing the agritouristic French supply and its main evolution factors, from scientific work led between 2000 and 2005. Our purpose is to serve the implementation of FEADER, thanks to these pieces of information.	agricultural;green tourism;agricultural population
11	Comparaison between several types of constructed wetlands using the life cycle assessment method. This paper presents the preliminary results of a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) study comparing four different types of Constructed Wetlands (CWs) plants, 1) two stages of Vertical flow bed with flushing feeding systems (fVfV) 2) one stage of Vertical flow bed with pump feeding and recirculation (pVr) 3) two Verticals flow beds followed by one Horizontal flow bed, with flushing feeding system (fVVH), 4) two Verticals flow beds followed by one Horizontal flow bed, without batch feeding (VVH). Environmental impacts have been modelled according to the LCA model software SIMAPROÒ. The first results show that the biggest environmental impact is showed by pVr, notably because of its electric consumption. Designers should decide carefully how complex the treatment system needs to be in order to guarantee the ecosystems safety.	constructed wetlands
12	Design of communicating spatial information systems for agrosystems - Towards a methodology adapted to specificities and new needs of the agricultural domain. The new needs for monitoring agricultural practices are leading to the developpement of a new computer-based application type. The main characteristics of these applications are georeferenced data and interactions beetween remote programs. The setting up of new computer-based agricultural systems needs combined skills in the geomatic field and in the communicating system field. The specification of this system type is complex and the use of a structured methodology is essential. This paper presents the capabilies offered by the different methods generally used in projects for agricultural communicating applications.	communicating spatial;agricultural
13	Contribution of remote sensing for the analysis and mapping of the Armorican bocage landscape. Nowadays, managing landscapes requires reference documents that must be ever more precise and comprehensive. Remote sensing analysis of the Armorican bocage, as dealt with in this paper, answers this kind of requirement. The variety of spatial resolutions as provided by remote sensing data, from satellite images to aerial photographs, allows multiple ways of studying the Bretagne (Brittany) landscape, which range from the mapping of rural landscapes to the characterization of the bocage structure. Resulting from such analyses, and a demand of the landscape planning authorities, this paper offers an approach to the study of the bocage landscape in the Côtes-d’Armor, relying upon a multi-scalar and hierarchical usage of airborne and space data. This approach has also been conceived so as to permit finer analyses in landscape ecology.	
14	Virtual mudflows and avalanches: a visual communication and characterisation tool for natural hazards in the mountains. The prevention of natural risks in mountainous areas: snow avalanches and debris-flows, requires more and more complex numerical simulations. These require to take into account the behaviour of complex materials as well as delicate numerical methods. These simulations provide after several hours or days of computation large quantities of data. The last step of the process is to communicate such results to the public and people in charge of political decisions. Considering the tools of decision making in the framework of natural risks in mountainous areas is still hardly accessible to non-specialists, we have initiated a research project whose goal is to use the generation of synthetic images to improve the level of possible communication of existing numerical tools. In practice, the goal of this research is to develop a series of tools making possible to go through from the simulation of natural risks to their graphically realistic representation. After a short presentation of numerical models, we present in details the work carried out to improve the structure of computation mesh according to the topography in order to make computations faster and more accurate, to validate models in the field by comparison to real events and to build a graphically realistic representation of the flows.	natural;research;prevention of natural risks
15	From theoretical ecology to engineering. Role of the engineer in ecology at Cemagref: the example of ski domains. Currently, a great knowledge exists in the field of restoration and creation of ecosystems. It deals with the operations on soils and vegetation species used for the rehabilitation of disturbed ecosystems. The engineer in ecology, who owns this knowledge, can be considered as an expert for managers and fulfils their needs in a perspective of sustainable development. However it is still necessary to carry out researches to determine the significance of the various parameters involved in the success of the revegetation actions and the evolution of the pioneer ecosystem. It is also advisable to start an important discussion about the consequences of climatic changes on the tourist activity in mountain lands.	evolution;engineering;ecology
16	"The usefulness of the notion of governance for analysing local tourism management methods: the example of the resort of Les Arcs. The ski resorts are confronted with many uncertainties as well structural as of the economic situation; the nature of their management constituting a significant theme of reflexion in the majority of the resorts. Indeed, the law ""Montagne"" conferred on the communes the responsibility for the piloting of the stations; a management that the communes assume or delegate to private operators (with delegations of public services). These choices lead to forms of varied relationships between private and public actors and often oppose two models of management, the corporate model and the community model. This paper wants to show that the concrete situations are rather in-between, where the goal is rather to describe the actors' system, their actions' modalities like their modes of coordination. In this field, the informal content matters just as much as the formal contents of the relations between actors, leading to qualify the formal and informal arrangements between public and private interests, from which are taken and applied the decisions. This overlap formal-informal strongly guided our analysis of the resort of the Arcs in Savoie, where we will underline in one hand, the lack of common reference framework between the commune and the private operator in charge of the skiable field and in the other hand, the will of certain associations to push to join again a dialogue, precondition to choices and decisions collectives."	management
17	Definition and integration on regional scale of action scenarios to fight diffuse pollution in rural environnements. A non point source pollution diagnosis method has been built and tested on Cétrais watershed (Western part of France). This method includes a description of farmers' practices for several years, the ability of soils to transfer nutrients and pesticides, and the main pathways between fields and the watershed outlet. As phosphorus was mainly provided by a little town, this diagnosis method has not been applied for phosphorus. For nitrogen, measurements in water indicate that the method seems relevant, because it describes with a relatively good precision the amounts of nitrogen flowing from fields to the water. Fertilisation reasoning appears to be the main cause for nitrogen losses, especially because of manuring methods and grasslands ploughing, which allows accumulation of delayed nitrogen release. The ability of soils to transfer nutrients will then determine the speed of leaching. For pesticides, the first investigations confirm that some ditches are able to decrease the amounts transferred from the fields to the river. The ability of a wetland located near the outlet to collect the water coming from the river has been evaluated.	phosphorus;watershed;france;cétrais watershed;water

A relationship model between the "" classic method "" (time expensive : 2,5 hours for 25 ha) and the "" five minutes "" one (all the egg-masses seen are counted during a straight walking of 5 minutes) was etablished from data of 14 woodplots. With only a walking for 5 ha, a reliable defoliation risk estimation is obtained. This method shares out the spent time by 5."	populations
19	Design of a database for dam ageing scenarios (CASCAD project). Roughly half of the 250 or so French dams classified as «regarding the safety of the public» are more than 30 years old and are therefore ageing. The regulation annual and ten-year inspections of these dams have produced a rich body of data on dam deterioration and behaviour. The research project CASCAD* described here aims at creating a database in order to better understand and predict the future performance of operational dams. For meeting these requirements, a Data Base Management System for managing both historical data and ageing scenarios is proposed. The main idea behind our approach is to provide civil engineering specialists with an aid for retrieving the most representative scenarios matching with the known history of the dam under examination. The next step of the research aims at taking into account within scenarios, remedial or repairing actions. *CASCAD: Computer Aided SCenarios for Ageing of Dams.	dams
20	Technical survey and evaluation of water and sewerage services . A new and simple method of technical surveying and valuation of water or sewerage services has been developed. The methodology is based on the simulation of an ideal and theoretical service adapted to the local environmental and demographic situation and reconstructed according to its basic equipment and operating costs. In the first stage, assets are set against current and future needs. Investments or specialised investigations can be recommended. The operating tasks are then compared to good practise (efficiency of leak detection, pipe repairs, reservoir cleaning etc). In the second stage, prices can be compared to consolidated elementary costs. This can be done by comparing asset depreciation to effective provisions and operating prices to assessed costs. The method ends with a financial study of public accounts allowing a simulation of investments scheduled over the next 10 years, with the resultant impact on the water price.	water

Facing an unrealistic fascination for agrofuel by common people, the author examines one by one the results of the Life Cycle Assessment of rape seed biodiesel, after defining this method. A more finely-shaded view is established, in which uncertainties are high, especially regarding effect on global warming. Consequently, a discussion on the issues for the world agriculture is provided, with some possible actions aiming at the reduction of transport.	rape seed biodiesel;global warming;world agriculture
22	Dams with open outlets for flood control: some lessons to be learnt since 1905. This paper aims at sharing feedback about dry dams. These structures are efficient to mitigate floods, while little disruption of the continuity of the main channel and its flows outside the flood periods. Five sets of dams are presented here. They were selected so as encompass the diversity of the structures and of the problems. The oldest structures are presented first. These are dams built in the beginning of the twentieth century in Poland and in the USA, which are still in operation today. Then, recent realisations in France are presented. Large dams in Gard catchment and small dams upstream the nearby town of Nîmes are described, with analyses of behaviour during intense floods. Finally, small dams in Seine-Maritime allow to address the issue of an efficiency diagnostic at catchment's scale, when both dams and stakes are spread out. This article gives key references for further information about structures design.	floods
23	Geomembrane waterproofing of the Berre drinking water reservoir. The Causse Méjean Inter-Municipal Drinking Water Supply Syndicate (SIAEP Causse Méjean, Lozère, France) has had a drinking water storage basin built. The basin is on a permeable karstic plateau and is lined with a geomembrane. For environmental reasons, this geomembrane was covered with natural materials: limestone rocks and slabs from the site. The basin was filled in the autumn of 2004. After examining the objectives and conditions of this development and the way in which the construction work proceeded, we present a few lessons learned from the project. In particular, in situ test areas for the installation of Geomembrane Liner Systems (GLS) on slopes are described and attention is drawn to the precautions to be taken when installing a cover structure on a geomembrane on slope.	water;rocks
24	Evolution of animal nitrogen emissions in municipalities of the Brest bay area watershed. The report about animal waste production in the watersheds of the Brest roadstead show that this region was already in 1988 an intensive livestock farming zone, with high concentration of breeding, particularly in pig and poultry. Between 1988 and 1993, these productions increased at a considerable rate, especially in poultry, and are one of the sources of nitrogen pollution in this part of Brittany.	evolution;animal nitrogen;nitrogen;pig
25	"Are there processing options for manure in Ireland?. Two of the objectives of manure processing are the requirements to reduce the pollution potential and to increase the efficiency of nutrient recovery by the crop. However, land spreading is the most sustainable manure ""processing"" option for most Irish livestock farms. Improving the reliability of the manure nitrogen for grass silage production remains an important requirement in terms of crop nutrient recovery. Intensive pig and poultry farms may increasingly examine and adopt processing options as legislative controls on their operations continue to increase. In this context, technological solutions to facilitate manure transport (e.g. concentration and sterilisation) and reduce odour emissions are the primary requirements of any processing option. However, manure management standards must continue to improve before serious consideration can be given to the implementation of any processing options on Irish farms with manure problems."	ireland;processing;manure processing
26	Constructed wetlands and waste stabilization ponds for municipal wastewater treatment in France: comparison of performance and maintenance operations in terms of durability and reliability. In France, vertical flow constructed wetlands and waste stabilisation ponds are both extensive treatment processes well adapted to small rural communities mainly because they are easy to operate and their performance is reliable. Most of the time, the effluent has a better quality than required by legislation; even if WSP performance can be affected by seasonal variations, especially as regards nutrients. For VFCWs, nitrate concentrations remain high due to the fully aerobic conditions prevailing in the 2nd stage filters. In the 1st stage filters only a little denitrification can occur in the drainage layer when water is temporarily stored to batch feed the 2nd stage filters. For both processes the removal of sludge accumulated in the first pond/filters is only necessary every 10 years or more at nominal load. Dry matter content of the sludge removed from VFCWs is obviously higher than that from ponds. For both processes annual routine maintenance operations for a plant designed for 400 p.e. requires approximately 100 hours of presence at the plant by a member of the municipal staff. For a 1000 p.e. WSP plant, less time is needed than for a VFCW plant, because of the annual harvesting of the aerial part of the reeds. Once sludge is removed, these plants are ready to perform a new cycle of operation without having to change any electro-mechanical equipment. This contributes greatly to the reliability of performance.	wetlands;france;water
27	Drainage geocomposites: relation between water flow capacity and thickness in the long term. The water flow capacity of a drainage geocomposite is intuitively related to its thickness, hence the importance of the creep knowledge. The creep of a geosynthetic is its time-dependent thickness decrease, under a constant stress, under compressive, or compressive + shearing loading. This work deals with four different drainage geocomposites types, each one with a different kind of geospacer. Their creep behaviour has been studied under simple compressive loading and also with a shearing loading. Then their water flow capacity in the long term has been evaluated in reasoning on their time-dependent thickness decrease. Reduction factors have been deduced of those results: they are very different according to the type of the geospacers (compressible or not).	water;reasoning
28	Geosynthetics and landfills. The construction and the closure of landfills involve geosynthetic lining and drainage systems to meet the regulation requirements for the protection of the environment. Following the review of the landfill specific conditions, the actual use of geosynthetics is presented according to the main functions: watertightness, drainage, protection, filtration. The general lines of the market evolution are also out-lined.	environment;landfills;evolution
29	"Geosynthetic materials and applications. For many years, planning and environmental issues have led to the emergence of new materials, which are called synthetic materials (geotextiles, geomembranes and associated products). These are materials often described in numerous books: transportation infrastructure, water structures development, industrial and agricultural effluent retention, waste-stocking centres... In term of efficiency and durability, these materials properties, their being adequate to environment and most of all specific techniques of their establishment are determinant points. This special release proposes 12 communications that were presented at the ""Geosynthetic Meeting 99"", which was organised by the French Comity of Geosynthetics on the 12th and 13th October 1999 in Bordeaux."	
30	History of biological engineering techniques applied to watercourses. Living plants have been used for a very long time, everywhere in the world, in structures against soil erosion. At its best in France during the 19th century, bioengineering has increased in attention in Europe since the thirties. This paper identifies, based on an extensive bibliography, different kinds of structures built in the past, in the rivers and on the riverbanks, mainly in Europe. From booms in fascine or weaving until sowing on the riverbanks or wicker basket, many techniques, single or blinded, are outlined. Today, structures combine more and more modern materials (geotextiles for example), sometimes synthetic, and plants.	biological engineering;france
31	Technical inefficiency and reduction of livestock effluents: the case of pig production. A brief review of the economic literature introduces the notion of inefficiency. This concept is defined by the distance between the observed production level and the maximum attainable level of output, which could be reached when inputs use is technically efficient. In the literature, many parametric and nonparametric approaches are developed. Next, we employ a nonparametric method, Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) based on linear programming to estimate the technical efficiency of a cross-section of 107 French pig farms. DEA permits a classification of the farms according to their technical efficiency. Half of these are estimated to be efficient with a score equal to 1. The results show that technical inefficiency is linked to low levels of education characterising the oldest farmers. A more complete approach would require a larger sample to compute both scale efficiency and technical efficiency.	pig;production;efficiency;economic literature;technical efficiency
32	Using models in ecological engineering: examples with the forest stand dynamics model SAMSARA. Models may be used at different steps of an ecological engineering approach. Their first role is to help us formalise our knowledge. In a research context, their prediction capacity allows us to test various assumptions about the processes at work in the system. Models may also be used to elaborate management guidelines. In the context of a local application, a model may help an engineer to adapt his general knowledge to the specific context, to establish a diagnostic and adapt management strategies. The models required for this approach are nevertheless usually sophisticated. Models may also be used as mediating instruments in project negotiations. Their use for training allows also to implicate trainees through stimulating practical work. Using models for ecological engineering presents nevertheless difficulties, as well at the level of their conception and evaluation as at the level of their use at a reasonable data collection cost.	ecological engineering
33	The management of livestock manure in Norway. Based on the present nutrient situation in watercourses, Norway has a serious nitrogen-to-saltwater problem and a serious phosphorus-to-freshwater problem. In addition, the ammonia-to-air problem is of importance. In livestock regions 85-90% of the farmland is used for grass production. This represent a challenge for manure management. The main reasons for the pollution problems from manure are; the farmer does not know the exact amount of manure required nor the effect of nutrients in the applied manure; overloading of mineral fertilizer, especially nitrogen, is common; 7-8,000 manure stores are in need of repair or are too small, 2-3 % of the livestock farms lack sufficient area for applying manure. As the majority of the farms have a balanced manure supply to their land, improved application is more important than treatments to prevent environmental problems. A new technology for slurry injection into grassland, called DGI® Direct Ground Injection, represents an important step forward in predicting the nitrogen effect, minimizing the ammonia emission, and making the application onto grassland more attractive. A slurry meter for on-line monitoring of the applied amounts per hectare makes it easier to dose the nutrient supply according to requirement of the grassland or crop.	norway
34	"Implementation of a ""territory forest chart"" : the example of the Pyrénées-Orientales. A major evolution in forest policies during the last years has been an increased awareness of the multifunctional role of forest. The recent Law on Forest in France puts this concern ahead of its fundamental principles. The ""Territory Forest Chart"" is a tool introduced by the law to reach this objective. Its main goal is to gather all forest stakeholders of a relevant territory around a common project, in order to best integrate forest development in its economical, ecological, social and cultural environment. The practical example of the management planning of cork oak (Quercus suber) stands in the Pyrénées-Orientales illutrates perfectly this new policy orientation."	environment;evolution
35	The development of tourist amenities in rural areas for an elite. The high demand for nature and authenticity boosts rural tourism. This market encourages to consider rural space's amenities as unquestionable attributes. Are they really? Amenities not only depend on actors, but those, which are exploited, are acknowledged by tourists with high economical and cultural resources. Rural space, turning into a leisure area for an elite, specializes and becomes common in order to respond to customers who are becoming fewer. In terms of procedures, the notion of attribute goes along with a rationalization of development projects, which are subject to the demand law. On the opposite, approaches based on the providers' motivation and culture show other possible ways.	rural areas;rural space;amenities
36	Flood prevention. Technical and economic characteristics of dynamic flood retention development. Floods are the most common natural disasters in France. With increasing urbanization, more and more inhabited areas are vulnerable involving damages which are an economic charge all the more significant as the events are violent and frequent. To overcome the wrenching impacts of these phenomena, the scientific and technical research is turned towards the technique of the dynamic flood retention. This special issue is based on the latest scientific and technical breakthroughs and the experience feedback stored up for several years. The objective of this special issue is to present the necessary technical knowledge to local decision makers in order to design floods prevention measures and to make development projects reducing flood consequences.	flood;natural disasters;france
37	Farming institutions in the arena of urban land management in the Toulouse urban area. Periurbanisation in France produces spread-city urban form, with an intertwinning of development and rural areas near cities. This phenomenon is quite strong in the Midi-Pyrénées Region, in the south-west of France, mostly because of the growing of the city of Toulouse. In the same time, relationships between farming and city have changed, and a growing number of cities consider farmlands in the scope of their land management and land development attributions. In this paper, we propose to analyse for the Toulouse urban area the representation of farming and of farm lands in the public land management process, and the distinct stakeholders in this process, among whom the agricultural institutions	france

The progress achieved over the past 30 years in improving the pysico-chemical quality of stream water has made a contribution to the significant regeneration of their ecological state. However, these improvements seems today to have reached their optimum and the solutions to restore a still sometimes mediocre ecological state, goes through resorption of remaining hydromorphological dysfunctions. This paper reviews the underlying concepts of hydromorphological restoration and presents some principles of implementation.	hydromorphological;water
39	Improving agricultural spreading of pasty sewage sludge by using rheological analysis: model experiments. Agricultural reuse of pasty sewage sludge is analyzed in the mechanical viewpoint. We first present a new concept of rheological characterisation, which shows that these materials present a dual behavior with both viscoelastic solid-like and viscous liquid-like parts. The abrupt transition occurs at a critical shear stress, which is of importance to study the spreading. On a rotating disk, the material flows abruptly only when the critical shear stress is reached. We finally show that in a dimensionless form, the spreading starts always at a critical point, which can be easily determined independently.	agricultural;sewage sludge
40	The vulnerability of establishment receiving the public and the companies in flood-prone zone: an assessment method in the watershed of Orb (Hérault, France). As part of the implementation of the flood mitigation plan supported by French government, we have realized a study of the vulnerability of establishments receiving the public and the companies faced with the flooding risks of the Orb and its tributaries. Our study deals with the Orb High Valley area that is affected by damageable Mediterranean flash floods. The assessment of vulnerability is led in five communes for which the Prevention of Predictable Natural Hazards Plan (PPR), has been approved. The first aim was to set up a diagnosis method of the vulnerability of all establishments admitting public (school, shops...) as well as companies located in flood prone zone. This method, based on a semi quantitative analysis assesses for each establishment, the human and economic vulnerability as well as the existence of protection and mitigation measures. This can be seen as personalized shits included in a Geographic Information System which use is very easy and fast. The study has brought out many problems common to the five communes: an important deficiency of protection and prevention measures at most of those establishments and a global lack of awareness on the flooding risk and the ability of dealing with it. Various solutions are proposed to reduce vulnerability (cofferdam, information campaign).	flood;flood prone;france

42	The Erstein polder: objectives, developments and feedback over five years of operation and scientific environmental monitoring (Rhine, France).. After a brief presentation of the Upper Rhine River and its engineering works, this paper presents the technical characteristics of the Erstein polder, a technical feedback and some results of the interdisciplinary environmental monitoring after the five first years of functioning. The observed ecological benefits concern mainly hydrology, hydro-geology and chemistry of waters. On this basis, some preliminary recommendations are proposed for the future management of the polder	
43	Development of rural areas in Great Britain: account. This account is placed within an approach at understanding European situations as regards development of rural areas. It suggests, on the one hand, the identification of the characteristics of British rural areas which are comparable or different from French areas, and on the other hand, the placing and description of the political questions which are important today in Great Britain for rural development and the methods which are being used to foster such a development. Among the comparable situations, a certain decline of rural areas is mentioned, then a certain revival, in taking the elements of the European Policy into account as well as welfare to the least favoured social strata. After a review of historical and cultural differences between the two countries, particularly on the level of town-countryside relations, the main questions which come up to the British society are developed in it.	great britain;areas;rural areas
44	The EAFRD, a new step towards a European forest policy?. Integrating the forests to the CAP, within the territorial pillar, impacts the French national forest policy. The EU regulation for the FEADER, for 2007-2013, brings new financing rules notably for non market functions, as biodiversity, landscapes protection, and public recreation. The sylvo-environmental new measures, and the support to collective projects notably through animation, provide new means to implement innovative actions for the rural development. These opportunities have to be seized by the foresters, still shocked by the recent storms, and by the economic crisis they have maintained.	forests
45	Natural lagooning in France: state of the art and recent trends. Waste stabilisation ponds (WSP) represent 20% of the total number of wastewater treatment plants in France. Practical expertise acquired during these last 20 years has led to modification in design of the first facultative basin of WSP systems. Its active surface area is now dimensioned at 6m2(p.e.)-1 in order to limit the risk of malfunctioning. The cumulated surface of the 2nd and 3rd basin is maintained at 5m2.(p.e.)-1. Another practical point is also that WSPs must receive mainly diluted influents. Globally, the plants are on average far from their nominal loads, which explains that the first sludge removals took place on average 13 years after being put in operation. Based on a representative sample of plants, i.e. 15% of the French WSPs, it has been possible to estimate the time, material means and cost needed for sludge removal as well as the amount of sludge accumulated. The sludge removed at the 1st removal yields on average 110L.(p.e.)-1 which represents 12 kg DM.(p.e.)-1. The current trend of increasing the levels of quality necessary for discharge into sensitive receiving bodies has led to adaptive solutions of polishing treatments by Intermittent Sand Filter Systems with or without the plantation of reeds.	france;art;natural
46	"The Marais Breton Loire-Atlantique (Western France): a forgotten marsh labelled as a landscape. This study about landscape and public actions in the Marais Breton Loire-Atlantique deals with the following subjects successively: the assessment of public action, the relevance of the Marais Breton as a space for intervention, and the landscape as an object for policies of intervention by the institutions who intervene in the Marais Breton. It leads to a first observation: on the one hand, there are no public actions with landscape among their main objectives, and, on the other hand, the Marais Breton's relevance is low as a space for intervention. It goes beyond this observation and analyses a two-fold process: 1) the institutions who intervene in the rural space are building the landscape as an object for intervention policies, in four registers - technical, cognitive, political, symbolic-; 2) the Marais Breton as a space for intervention, is qualified in four ways - naturalistic, agricultural, hydraulic and landscape. It concludes with a discussion about the possible ways for the future, and notably with the necessary inclusion of the farmers to define specific landscape issues, in order to avoid the landscape being reduced to a simple "" principle "" or some "" small technical standards ""."	agricultural;france;marais breton;landscape
47	Residual sludge: what characterization and environmental impacts for spreading?. The production of the residual sludge from the wastewater treatment plant raises constantly. The physical and chemical characterization of residual sludge becomes an important challenge to maximize their valorisation by agricultural spreading. This special issue deals with the last scientific results concerning the definition of characteristics of the residual sludge, composition and consistency and methods of treatment. It presents some aspects of scientific results on the unknown consequences concerning their spreading on the plant development, soils and concentration of heavy metals in the plants.	sludge
48	The configurations of agri-environmental schemes: a typology of systems encouraging farms to produce environmental goods. A comparative study on different angles (making, implementation, actors, aims, means, etc.), of several agri-environmental schemes permitted the building of an expert typology of these encouraging systems. The constants lead to the description of four types (called configurations), based on the interactions between representatives of the social demand and farmers during the making of the projects and the implementation of the prescriptions. This typology gives light to systems encouraging the production of environmental goods and allows to develop suitable strategies for different contexts.	
49	Main factors of pesticide transport towards surface waters. Since several decades, numerous studies have analyzed the processes of water contamination by pesticides. They have led to the understanding of the main contamination pathways both at the field scale, at which the pesticide is applicated, and at the catchment scale, at which the water resource forms. The factors of pesticide transfer to surface and ground waters are well known from a qualitative point of view. This paper reviews the main factors. But the quantification of the effects of these transfer factors and of their interactions remains partial and requires to be carried on. This is essential both for evaluating the contamination risks linked with various forms of agricultural land management and for seeking new management practices that will control water contamination in given agricultural and hydrological environments.	pesticide
50	"The social functions of the forest. To look at forest uses in a historical perspective leads to find out that the multifunctionality of forest is an old story, as well as to understand that forest uses have always been a matter of conflicts. Forest belongs to long term. From the Middle Ages to the Industrial Revolution, forests have been the main – nearly unique – source of energy. Its ressources provided work to many craft and manufacturing industries. Finally, through the customary rights, farmers made forests an annex of the fields: complementary pastoral area and mine of fertilising materials. Same activities, same uses, same never ending conflicts between the eminent owners of the soil and the neighbouring populations. But, from the beginning of the XIXth century, the use of wood and the forest uses have been deeply transformed. More and more subjected to the needs of the industry, the forest became gradually separated from the rural economy, when it was more and more frequented by urban people looking for Nature recreation. Owners and managers need today to take into account new ""social functions"" of the forests. It means they are facing new uses and have to take care of their impact on stands dynamics. It means also they are facing new conflicts of uses and they should arbitrate between their objectives and those of users. After looking at the possibilities of law and economical calculation, as well as their limits, the paper invites to look into the rationality of political debates the way of defining compromises acceptable by all stakeholders."	
51	Pesticide risk indicators for surface water and their validation: Example of the I-PHY indicator. The implementation of solutions to the problem of non-point source pollution due to pesticides requires the development of assessment tools of the risk associated to the application of those products. If pesticides risks indicators are currently recognised for the environmental assessment of farmers'practices, numerous studies during the last decade did not enable to conclude about their validity. The article aims at presenting results of an experimental validation of the surface water component of the I-Phy indicator from measurements of pesticide concentration in water. After a brief review of different types of indicators, we present the surface water component of the I-Phy indicator which was developed at INRA Colmar in the frame of the INDIGO® method. The construction is based on decision rules using fuzzy logic. In the surface water component, variable describing fields conditions, sensitivity to runoff and drift play a major role. In a second part, we present and discuss results of experimental validation using dataset of concentration measurement of active ingredient from three locations (Rouffach, Le Ruiné, Baslieux-sous-Châtillon). They yield a medium quality of prediction which can be partially explained by the upscaling of the indicator to watershed level.	pesticide;water
52	Agricultural and rural policies of French sub-national authorities. The reinforcement of decentralization in France and regionalization in Europe lead to take into account and to analyze the interventions of local public authorities: departments and regions. The framework of local economic interventions opens new perspectives. Concerning agricultural supports, the amounts devoted to the development of agriculture appear weak but their interest rests in their orientation: animation of the networks of actors, support to territorial demonstrations or to local productions.	france;agricultural;europe
53	New needs in forest information. The paper presents firstly the reasons for reappraising the ongoing system of forest information, and then exposes some projects undertaken by ECOFOR with the aim of improving its efficiency. Finally, it proposes three prioritary projects, concerning respectively a typology of forest owners, the implementation of a pilot regional forest information system, and an observatory of the french forest.	
54	Do new technologies threaten the environment or provide the means of feeding humanity in the 21st century?. Technological development of western agriculture has known undeniable success over the last decades; however, its sustainability has been questioned. What will be the situation in the 21st century? First, a socio-economic and ecological assessment of the recent development is sketched from the French situation taking into account both its favourable and negative sides. The second part deals with the possible impacts of a major wave of innovations, which is beginning to come into use: a better knowledge and handling of the living matter, particularly with biotechnology and genetic engineering. Their potential advantages and possible risks are sketched out from a socio-economic and environmental point of view. Another technological ongoing development, which is also quite significant, is presented in the third part: growing utilization of knowledge, of information and of the new information technologies in the agricultural sector. Their possible impacts are also examined from a socio-economic and environmental point of view. The last section questions the capacities to feed the human growing population. It seems essential to increase food production, but without damaging the environment: this requires a «double green revolution». Under certain conditions biotechnology and the use of knowledge could go in this way, but many other conditions are required, particularly an intensive mobilization at both a socio-economic and institutional level.	environment;agriculture;biotechnology
55	Extension phenomena: analysing, understanding and foreseeing. Spontaneus extensions play an important role in the progression of forests in France and they often concern species, which are technologically interesting. They thus contribute to the diversity of the forests and consequently to that of the forest production. However, they often shut off the landscape. To manage them more efficiently, it must be possible to foresee their extension and their type. This implies having information concerning on the modification of the socio-economic context which determines changes in the use of the soil and/or modification of the agricultural practices, besides the basic underlying process, of the dynamics of vegetation. Apparently, there are two approaches. The first is based on the notion of succession after a complete stop in the use of agricultural or grazing ground. The second approach is based rather on the dynamics of the plant population and its variability as a function of human influences. After an analysis of these two approaches, we explain why the second is preferable. Although this approach, based on the dynamics of the plant population, is relatively difficult to apply, it has the major advantage of going beyond the simple description of types of vegetation, valid only in the area in which it was studied. The interrelations and the processes detected in one spot can be generalised and applied in other places where they will be expressed in a similar or different manner depending on the ecological context. They give a key to understanding the transformations of the landscape, taking into account the features of each element of the mosaic and the operation of the landscape as a whole. 	agricultural;population
56	Nature representations and the management of plant diversity on substructures constructions. Managers need pragmatic representation of nature suited to the restoration of the biodiversity on side roads, river embankments or on ski trails. In this article, simple representations are drawn up from the ecological theory of hierarchy. A simple model aimed to the ecological restoration of the vegetal diversity at the local scale is deduced from some properties of that structure. This model is used for the valuation of the vegetal diversity reconstitution on ski trails. At the landscape level, this hierarchical viewpoint allows to assess the impacts of a ski resort on landscape vegetal diversity from aerial photography analysis.	ski
57	Ecological Engineering in rivers: using up the left-overs or acting for an integrated ecosystem management?. Relying on research works on the dynamics of the freshwater systems and the physical factors controlling the aquatic habitats, this paper overviews the free operating principles of the rivers and their ecological balance. Then we are faced with the problem of the scales of intervention as regards ecological engineering. Aren't the local actions likely to be useless - even misleading - if they are disconnected from a global approach of the ecosystem? If the general principles to avoid these pitfalls are well known and reminded by eminent scientists, a lot of research developments should be carried out to integrate the various space and time scales.	ecological engineering;research
58	Frette-sur-Seine (Val-d'Oise) landscape inventory. The Frette-sur-Seine, small city with a population of 4,000, is located 15km from Paris. The Seine river, vacation constructions built at the turn of the century, and a dense plant cover explain the landscape quality of the hillsides. There are many associations of protection of the environment in this city, and their opinions are not always in line with the city officials' choices (densification and development of some areas,...); this explains the difficulty to manage the future of the city landscape. In the framework of the study performed to take into account landscape into urban development documents, CAUE proposed to the city a landscape inventory. The confrontation of this inventory with the current land-use plan (LUP) is used to define the rules of a « qualitative » LUP. This article explains the various levels of analysis used to perform this landscape inventory. The study allowed to increase the awareness of elected officials and technical services about the landscape concept and the inventory principle. It highlighted the need for a large scale intercommunity approach, for an educational approach and for a monitoring in order to optimize the use of the inventory.	environment;landscape
59	"Cropping systems design in watersheds used for drinking water: innovations, feedback and lessons learned. France try to implement multifunctionnal agriculture linking preservation of water quality and economical performance of farms on 20000 watersheds used for drinking water. The environmental issues pointed out cropping system concept - sensu lato: as, crop and grassland management- and the central role of cropping systems spatial organisation at the landscape scale. More precisely, we have to understand, diagnose and re-design this spatial organisation of cropping system at the watershed scale. We use five in situ re-designing of cropping systems in Lorraine and Burgondy, to draw a general framework for water resources protection in the watersheds. The authors focuse on two steps: the territorial diagnosis though a local and common design for the future cropping systems, and the implementation of this foresight through a share planning. This planning uses two axes: the evolution of cropping systems, and the relocation of cropping systems through land re-design. This planning is based on the capacity of local stakeholders to coordinate their own evolutions in this common plan. In the future, these watersheds could be territory frozen with strict reglementations or could be on the opposite ""local innovations laboratories"" to learn together the future of a multi-functionnal agriculture, with innovative cropping systemes, innovative landscape design, with agro-ecology principes. The water stakeholders will have the central role in this choice."	agriculture;water;watershed
60	Downscaling method for estimating the potential for nitrogen contamination of surface waters. This paper presents a model to evaluate the contamination potential due to intensive agriculture of surface water in the Save watershed (affluent of the Garonne). The originality of the model resides in the use of a very detailed spatial object, the pixel, adapted to many working scales. The studied land, situated in the hillsides of the Gers department, is constituted by three different size watersheds (Save, 1150 km2, Boulouze, 70 km2, and Montoussé, 6 km2). Indicators about agriculture and environment, built the model. They describe the vulnerability of environment and the agricultural pressure. The association of these indicators on a pixel indicates the contamination potential of superficial water. The diffuse pollution of nitrates illustrate these works. The specific model creating is called AZOTOPIXAL. The created method is the continuation of preceding works, which were oriented towards pesticides (PHYTOPIXAL model) and contributes to the actual researches on space scaling management.	agriculture;water;environment
61	Soil microclimatology under a jute netting: the example of a mountain road embankment. The principal aim of revegetating embankments is to control erosion. In order to fix the soil, biodegradable materials are often placed on the ground before the start of revegetation procedures. A measuring device was set up on the upstream embankment of a mountain road (La Bérarde, Isère Dept., France) for studying the influence of jute netting on germination factors (temperature, humidity). The jute does have a significant effect on both factors, by conferring to the soil a type of behaviour similar to vegetation.	jute netting
62	Model for the prediction of the degradation of polymer materials in a real environment. The objective of this work is to predict the biodegradabiliy of polymer materials in the natural environment from laboratory biodegradabiliy data, materials characteristics and environmental conditions. A model from a data processing approach combining both laboratory in vitro tests and in situ field tests was developed. With a neuronal system, the degradation level of a material in a given biotope has been modelled from a laboratory measurement and parameters characterizing the material and the site. We propose two models that allow to predict the rate of degradation of a material in a given environment and this with 86 % of suitable prediction with less of 15 % of error. This result allows us to compare the validity of the routine norm procedure (in liquid medium) with data obtained during real conditions	polymer;environment
63	Nitrogen and phosphorus export modelling in a small mediteranean watershed by analysis of variability of land use and topographic. The preservation of water bodies from eutrophication implies accurate estimation of phosphorus and nitrogen loads and the control of the nutrient production on a catchment scale. In this paper, a simple tool for the modelling of annual nutrient loads is presented. It is implemented in ArcInfo® GIS using Arc Macro Language (AML). The use of a GIS is justified as the spatial characteristics of the catchment area (land use, industrial wastewater location) dictate water quality. The annual nutrient loads are worked out on the catchment scale, using existing GIS routines together with specific routines developed in AML for hydrological and water quality modelling purposes. The catchment area is divided into hydrological subcatchments with relatively homogeneaous spatial characteristics. Each subcatchment is linked to a specific nutrient export potential. These nutrient loads, calculated on a subcatchment-by-subcatchment basis, are conveyed to the outlet of the catchment and allow annual nutrient load estimation. A comparison with a water monitoring study is conducted to verify the adequation of modelling results for phosphorus and nitrogen loads.	water;gis;phosphorus
64	Pesticide dispersion modelling during spraying. Study of pesticide dispersion within the environment is very complex. Experimental methodologies are unsatisfactory from the point of view of cost and reliability due to the manpower require and the variability of environmental conditions. Modelling approach allows phenomena to be separated, environmental and injection parameters to be varied through appropriate boundary conditions, and numerous experiences to be reproduced within limited time. Modelling dispersion within canopies focused on the effect of the crop features on the airflow behaviour and droplet cloud dispersion. Preliminary studies of leave movement in front of the airflow of an air-assisted sprayer were conducted and will be improved. Furthermore, pesticide dispersion within the air will be studied through air/droplet interactions.	pesticide;environment
65	"Note of lecture and analysis relative to works done at Madjid Bouzit, 2000: ""Economic assessment of Plans for Prevention against Risks and information value. Application to Sérignan, a French district. We here present a document written by Madjid Bouzit titled 'The economic assessment of natural hazard mitigation plans and the value of information; application to the Serignan town' (available only in French). We recall how these plans are drawn up, and also M. Bouzit's results on this subject, mainly through the Cemagref programme termed ASS. The use of a cost-benefit analysis (with costs that are certain whereas benefits are not) to three different levels (the State, the municipality, and the owners), for a town regularly subjected to floods, allows us to understand the difficulties (for instance the choice of an optimal mapping accuracy level) and, as a result, the opposition to drawing up and the reluctance to implementing these plans."	
66	Optimisation of the agricultural sprayers for a better distribution on the ground: virtual prototyping. The quality of the distribution on the crops of a plant health treatment is largely dependent on the stability of the spray booms. The maturity of the computer aided design systems make it possible today to tackle this problem through virtual prototyping. This indeed makes it possible to simulate the dynamic behaviour of a spraying system (including hydraulics and control aspects) in order to be able to optimise it, before reaching the pre-industrial stage.	agricultural
67	Tools for pastoral diagnosis and mountain pasture management. For the management of the mountain pastures, a first tool consisted in regional agro-ecological typologies, elaborated on the basis of quantified relevés of vegetation, environment characteristics and practices. These typologies allow (i) a simplified recognition of the pastoral vegetation by the way of a key of determination, (ii) the evaluation at the station level of the pastoral resource: productivity, animal carrying capacity, (iii) recommendations for the maintenance or the improvement according to dynamic of the vegetations linked to the pastoral practices. A second tool is proposed at the level of the pastoral units (50 to 500 ha) and at the level of large biogeographical areas in mountain (tens to hundreds thousands of hectares): the physiognomic mapping of the vegetation, based on remotely sensed data, at the 1/25 000 scale. These tools are illustrated by results obtained in applications carried out on the pastoral domain in the French Northern Alps.	environment
68	To preserve open landscapes in mountain: Differentiated contributions according to the different farming systems. A case study in Tarentaise valley (F-Savoy). Agricultural land use appears essential to maintaining open landscapes in mountain. These landscapes are regarded as an amenity by society and represent main stakes for local development in mountain regions. That is especially the case in the Tarentaise valley (F-Savoy), where a demand for landscape quality is expressed by local people due to the considerable tourism activities and by Beaufort-cheese cooperatives, whose strategy is to connect the quality of the cheese produced with the quality of landscapes and environment. The contributions of farming systems to open landscapes in the Tarentaise valley were studied. Because of their importance to landscape two types of agricultural areawere selected: slopes and areas with shrub development. The land uses were analysed according to the different farm types.	agricultural;mountain
69	"Landscape perception of abandoned areas and spontaneous afforestation of agricultural land. When analysing the environment, the term ""representation"" is more open than ""perception"", often used when describing new environmental questions. Apart from purely semantic considerations, the analysis and determination of the social representations of land left fallow and the spontaneous reforestation of agricultural land supposes identification of the model which structures this representation and forms its core. Landscapes resulting from fallow land have often been considered to reflect the poverty and misery of the population. On the other hand, a beautiful landscape, worthy of a modern nation, was cultivated and cared for, bearing as it were, the mark of the ceaseless toil of labouring peasants. These representations have evolved in the course of time. As the antithesis of ""ordinary space"" where nature is less and less present and replaced by technology, we can imagine space left untouched by social activities and the marks of technology gradually acquiring a new value, that of wild beauty. A way of answering the questions posed would thus be precisely to introduce nature into these ""ordinary spaces"". But this would require solving the problems of the relationship between society and its ways of considering these spaces and the reality of nature."	environment;agricultural;space;population
70	Efficiency of different geotextiles for the protection of the geomembrane at landfill sites. Protecting geotextiles are used in the design of watertight bottom liner of landfill sites, above the geomembrane to protect it against puncture during the installation of the drainage layer and, during the service life, to the weight of the waste to be put in place. To help in the design of the geotextile, a field test of 18 m x 30 m was undertaken. A geomembrane was put in place and several samples of geotextiles installed above it before the 50 cm thick gravel layer. A truck and a loader have run on the field tests to simulate the circulation of earthmovers. Observations of the geomembrane were undertaken in correlation with the type of geotextile installed on the area of concern. Geomembrane samples were taken for lab tests. Static damage tests were also undertaken to simulate the waste loading conditions.

This special issue is presenting a stateof the art in france on the biology and ecology of aquatic macrophytes (lichens, macro-algae, bryophytes, pteridophytes, phanerogams), present taxonomic tools, general phytosociological frame allowing identification of phytocenoses, ecophysiological specificities of these plants, community answers to environmental conditions and disturbances, their function in abiotic habitats, and their relation to aquatic fauna. Bioindication of watercourse quality based on macrophytes communities is also detailed, as well as water trophic indices, as a prospect of ecological status. The subject of spreading plants, native or exotic ones, is treated from the biological and ecological point of view. Applied topics such as management of these plants, conservation of rare or endangered species and control of invasive species are also presented.	france;ecology;water;art;freshwater;algae
72	Rural development policies and decision-making levels: an organisational approach. Due to their own complexity, related with the stakes and actors variety and interdependency, rural development concerns account for more and more sophisticated action settings, which contents is defined not only beforehand but also all along the implementation stage. This paper puts an analysis grid, which accounts for the multilevel organization of these action settings. This grid is then used to show the construction at different levels of the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) setting. Prospects are finally suggested about the conception of action settings in this field. 	agricultural;construction
73	Dynamic Flood Retention: principle and guidelines. Integrated Flood Management at catchment scale is the current paradigm. Dynamic Flood Retention is a relevant principle for its requirements, by mitigating floods wherever suitable opportunities exist on the catchment. It reduces the need for protection measures, which impair river ecosystems, like levees and river training. This paper advocates the need for a risk diagnosis to set reasonable objectives for hazard mitigation over the catchment. Then, Dynamic Flood Retention techniques with a measurable and significant effect on floods are described. Finally, guidelines are proposed to implement them at catchment scale when economically relevant. A first set of guidelines is devoted to efficiency assessment, and a second one to project management, with a focus on specifications drafting.	flood;flood retention;retention
74	Agricultural abandonment and socio economics stakes. Fallow land and forest extensions are considered as “non-spaces” or “non-beings” of the socio-economic reality. There are more or less forceful processes resulting in the abandoning of agricultural land, landowners’ strategies often difficult to identify and various dynamic processes from the ecological viewpoint and from that of occupying and using land.The first part of this analysis shows the influences of the economic policies on what we could call “the socio-economic dynamics of fallow lands and forest extensions”. The second part deals with the manner in which farmersmake their choices in terms of the land which they own and in what way the fallow land and the forest extensionare useful to them within the framework of the changes of the operating systems. Finally, these questions are dealt with at the level of the built-up territory, since any development of a plot involves a larger space and especially other forces besides the farmers and landowners. The consequences are to be measured at different levels, plots, farms, local territory, preference of the citizens and society for the use and management of natural resources and the environment. In particular, how is it possible to ensure the permanent control of these spaces and the necessary study of their place within contexts, which themselves evolve in the course of time.	agricultural;economic;environment;agricultural abandonment
75	Agricultural technologies and environmental management: contributions and limitations for the debate on environmental management. This paper takes as a basis that developments in agricultural technologies, in particular agricultural equipment and machinery (automation and robotisation), are important for the long term analysis of environmental management. It is based on the observation that projections developed from social, institutional and economic variables but which assume constant, or even non-existent, technological development are soon overtaken. The paper draws on an exercise to develop a projection as part of training at the Ecole Nationale du Génie Rural, des Eaux et des Forêts (ENGREF - National Rural Engineering School for Water and Forests) together with experts from Cemagref. It suggests that four stages require special consideration: formulation of the scope of such an exercise in terms of content and methodological and operational considerations; design and organisation of the exercise; identification of the main results; identification of the direction and conditions for extending such an approach, in particular depending on difficulties encountered. The exercise revealed in particular the need to cross-disciplinary and cultural boundaries in such an approach. It also allowed the definition of research directions and the delimitation of conditions in which this research could be carried out.	agricultural;research
76	How can ecological restoration operations be monitored and evaluated? Example of the wild coast of Quiberon.. Among the numerous operations of ecological restoration set up in particular on over-frequented sites of the French Atlantic coast, only few of them are the object of scientific (follow-up) monitoring, which are necessary for the evaluation of the success of used techniques. These surveys also allow to identify the blocking or the drift in the dynamics of the concerned systems. One of the reasons of this lack of such surveys is the absence of standardized, simple methodology allowing a global evaluation of such operations. Within the framework of a collaboration between scientists and site managers, we established a method of evaluation based on a simplified mapping and criteria allowing to monitor the dynamic of the system, without requiring deepened knowledge in botany or in ecology. The objective is to define a methodology, which can be operated at regular intervals, without prohibitive cost, within the framework of recent operations but also for a posteriori evaluation of older ones. 	ecological
77	Which indicators for energy assessment in agriculture in the Energy Performance Plan?. The energy balance is a tool widely used in French agriculture at the scale of the farms. It will be the basis for a diagnosis in the French Energetic Performance Plan. It provides data with similarities to accounting ones, but based on physical domain. These data may provide energy indicators, of which meanings and utilization are here examined according to the social expectations from agriculture and to the objectives of the French Energetic Performance Plan.	agriculture
78	Reduction of the presence of crop protection products in a small agricultural basin in Belgium. During the springs 1998 and 1999, a mass balance on a small catchment in Belgium, the Nil (32 km²), shows the dominance of point losses in the total load of the river for atrazine, isoproturon, chloridazon and lenacil. Following theses results a pilot-project was started in 2000 with the aim to reduce the crop protection products loads in the Nil catchment. The strategy adopted is first to inform the 50 farmers working on the site about the point sources problem and second to give them advice on the handling of the products in order to reduce the point losses. After one year, a load reduction of 75 % was obtained for some herbicides in the river. An action was also carried out by the municipality in order to reduce their use of diuron on roads.	belgium;farmers;agricultural
79	Rehabilitation of the watertightness of navigable canals using geomembranes. A series of studies conducted since 1996 on the use of geomembranes to rehabilitate the watertightness of navigable canals is presented. These studies concern feedback on experience (analysis of fourteen projects in France) and the carrying out of an in situ experiment on a canal bank. They also enable us to make a technical and economic analysis of the main systems that are currently possible to protect the geomembrane (concrete slabs, treated gravel, gravel and rock and suspended systems) and to propose a decision-making flowchart to guide the choice of system. An interesting example of rehabilitation on Rigole de l'Arroux is presented in details.	canals
80	Response of plant communities to environmental conditions: disturbances or constraints. In aquatic environments, disturbances can be floods, which induce flow velocities sufficient to cause erosion of the substrate and the uprooting of plant communities, or that promote alluvial deposits. Thus they create heterogeneity of habitats, which results in a wide variety of plant communities whose composition is related to the variability of the intensity of exchanges hydrological, quality and origin of waters. The species develop strategies adapted to the fluctuating water levels with variable intensity and frequency. In rivers not subject to flooding, plant communities that are expanding are organized as a sequence of vegetation according to a gradient of natural trophic level upstream downstream. Physical or chemical impairments (morphological changes in the bed, hydroelectric impoundment) change or even destroy this sequence. It shows that plant communities may be descriptors of hydrological functioning of the watercourse and/or biondicators of physical or chemical impairments.	floods
81	Representation of farmer's decisions faced with an agricultural-environmental policy: contributions of a knowledge engineering approach. This paper presents the main results of the SILEX research project. Main objectives of this project were: (i) to point out success factors of environmental policies among farmers, (ii) to point out ways able to improve the methods used to hyghlight these factors, and (iii) to facilitate the transfer of these methods. Success factors of policies were pointed out by simulating decision process within target farms of the studied policies, then by analysing relations existing between the highlited decisions and the context of these decisions (farm features, economic and regulatory context). Concepts, relations among concepts, and inference structure of the farmer decision-making processes were modelled by using knowledge engeniering technnologies (KADS methodology). SILEX project produced: (i) methods to point out success factors of three types of environnmental policies, (ii) indications about success factors of these policies, and (iii) ways to improve the current methods.	agricultural;research;farmers
82	Small dam removal: a tool for landscape and ecological river restoration? Focus on social issues French case studies Sèvre nantaise, Thouet (west of France). Small dam removal (most of them are watermills dams or irrigation weirs) has become a new option in river ecological restoration. From the United-States to European countries, dam removal (and particularly small dam removal) has emerged as a major environmental managment issue. The European Water Framework Directive (EWFD) encourages States and local authorities to reduce ecological impact of these hydraulic works (fish-pass, small dam removal). This new context leads to the increase of conflicts of use and to indecisive public policies. This article deals with this issue through the analysis of two cases studies in western France (Sèvre nantaise and Thouet).	france;water
83	 Feedback from an important site of a vibrating thin diaphragm cut-off wall on the EDF diversion canal at Strasbourg. Certain sections of the structures which divert the Rhine river in Alsace area have a double function: ensuring, of course, the lateral retention of water for navigation in the canal, but also contributing to the closing of several retention basins dedicated to the peak attenuation (mitigation) of large floods on the Rhine river. The retention basin at Strasbourg, which straddles the short-circuited section of the Rhine river, experienced partial first-filling in 1999. The untimely up-welling of alluvial groundwater on the French side halted the filling process. At the conclusion of a long process of studies, piloted by the German organisations in charge of the management of floods and lead by German specialists, the German party proposed at its expense the construction of an impervious barrier anchored into the ancient alluvium, 2.8 km in length, matching up the recent alluvial deposits and the more ancient river course, under the right-hand bank of the EDF diversion canal. The project was remarkable both by the height of the curtain in the ground (around 22 m) and by the area continuously treated (58,000 m2). The very short timeframe for completion of the project required by the Germans (20 months) nevertheless included time for a European competitive bidding process technically opened. The solution accepted after this bidding process (vibrating thin diaphragm cut-off wall combined with high pressure jetting injection) was achieved in Spring 2002 and required the use of huge site equipments.	floods;navigation
84	Literature review. An overview of the state of research on flood prevention. This literature review comments references selected so as to give an overview of the present state of researches on flood prevention. The scientific community is developing concepts and tools for risk integrated management, within the framework of sustainable development. This work is a great help for regional, national and European policies. Our list focuses on structural measures achieving flood mitigation by retention or slowing down. It is extended to flood processes, project design and relevant tools, as well as objective and integrated methods for project assessment. Many authors endeavour to reconcile flood management and environment conservation. Thus review shows a great diversity of hazard mitigation methods and assessment procedures. Conclusions about the impact of land-use on floods are somewhat diverging, or at least difficult to generalize. Similar techniques exits in urban areas for rainfall management, with different constraints less available room; this does not enter in our scope although a few references are given for comparison (Marsalek and Chocat, 2002 ; Certu, 2003).	flood;research;literature
85	First feedbacks on the safety and pathology of high-altitude dams for snowmaking. In winter sports resorts, the construction of dams to provide water storage for the snowmaking have significantly increased over the last decade. These high-altitude dams ranging from 1,300 meters to 2,500 meters, about 10 m high, are mostly waterproofed with a Geomembrane Sealing System (GSS) over the upstream face of the embankment and the whole reservoir. If uncovered, the geomembrane is directly exposed to multiple attacks: freeze-thaw cycles, UV radiation, impacts and tensile stresses due to the floating ice, stone falls, slope sliding, etc. Integrating results from a technical survey in a department of the French Alps and relating some recent incidents, this paper presents a first feedback on safety of high-altitude dams and proposes some actions to improve it.	water
86	Sensitivity analysis of a cost-benefit analysis. Lessons for the evaluation of flood alleviation projects. Cost-Benefit Analysis based on the damage avoided approach gives rise to several synthetic indicators measuring either the flood exposure of an area (mean annual damage), or the interest to conduct a flood prevention policy (mean annual damage avoided, net present value). Those indicators are the outcome of a combination of hydrological, hydraulic, geographic and economic models. Although it is recommended to study the precision of these indicators, this is rarely done in practice, as the combined models, which are needed are relatively complex. In this article, we present an approach, which is based on Monte-Carlo analysis, and discuss the insights, which can be drawn from it on the validity of the indicators.	
87	Processing strategies for farm livestock effluents. A European collaboration. Livestock numbers in the European Union (EU) represent nearly 10% of the world total; much of this is concentrated in specific regions. The resulting local manure surpluses have led to a series of environmental problems, especially water pollution, ammonia emission and odour nuisance. In response to this, many governments have introduced regulations specifying minimum requirements and restrictions for the storage and spreading of wastes. A common theme underpinning these rules is the closer matching of manure nutrient applications to their uptake by crops and the avoidance of spreading in sensitive areas. Treatment of wastes, including processing to produce useful products, represents an important waste management option; in some situations, treatment may indeed represent the only effective management option in satisfactorily dealing with the manure. Such processes have received considerable interest with much research now on-going in many countries. However, there is a need both to bring together many of the ideas being explored and to assess them in terms of effectiveness. An EU Concerted Action drawing on representatives from fourteen leading European institutions in the area of livestock waste management has been set up to focus effort in this task.	livestock;processing
88	How to treat raw sewage with constructed wetlands: An overview of the French systems. The development of Vertical Flow Constructed Wetlands treating raw wastewater in France has proved to be very successful over the last 20 years. In view of this a survey was carried out on more than 80 plants in order to study their performance and correct the design if necessary. This study shows that such systems perform well in terms of respecting the goals of both low level outlet of organic matter degradation (COD) and suspended material (SS) and nitrification. Pollutant removal performance in relation to the loads handled and the specific characteristics of the plants were investigated. Nitrification is shown to be the most sensitive process in such systems and performance in relation to sizing is discussed. Such systems, if well designed, can achieve an outlet level of 60 mg.l-1 in COD, 15 mg.l-1 in SS and 8 mg.l-1 in TKN with an area of 2 to 2.5 m2.PE-1. The sludge deposit on the first stage must be removed after about 10-15 years.	wetlands;sewage;france
89	Treatment of pesticides in constructed wetlands: from the natural attenuation to the management of bioremediation and phytoremediation. Most of pesticides contained in runoff waters go through constructed wetlands (CW). A decrease in pesticide concentrations is usually shown at the outlet of CW, without being optimized nevertheless. Basing on abiotic and biotic (microorganisms, macrophytes) parameters, this review aims at explaining the CW functioning for pesticide treatment. Suggestions are made to enhance performances of these processes. In particular, a minimum residence time of pesticides compatible with their biological degradation/extraction rate (bioremediation, phytoremediation) must be respected. Residence time can be set irrespective of the runoff level by improving pesticide adsorption on materials placed in CW.	pesticides;wetlands;natural
90	Some elements of preparation and territorial approach for the EAFRD measures: an analysis with the farms' functions combinations. There is a proximity between the focused aims for the rural development support and the various functions (economic, social and environmental), assumed by the farms. On this analysis, the authors propose a evaluative approach which is based on indicators taking into account the combinations of these same functions. These indicators are appreciated through the number of assumed functions and the profile-type of combination, on the scale of the farm as on the scale of a territory by the aggregation of the information calculated for each exploitation of this same territory. These two indicators were tested to identify the multifunctional farms in Rhone-Alpes. To reinforce this evaluative approach, the authors give some reflexion trends, in order to provide to the public authorities an accurate statistical basis. For this aim, we will use the information collected in the files of request for assistance CAP.	
91	A tool to characterise agricultural plastic film waste. While agricultural plastic films are increasingly used for crop protection purposes, they also generate waste when they reach their end-of-life and are abandoned. This raises the question of how to recover, recycle and dispose of these products under satisfactory economic and environmental conditions. In this context, the authors present here the development of a sampling tool and an analysis and sampling method specific to agricultural plastic film waste.	agricultural plastic films;agricultural plastic film waste
92	A quantitative approach of the impact of sampling frequency on uncertainties associated with the estimation of the annual nitrate load and average concentration in Brittany, France. The mission of most water quality monitoring networks is to evaluate the long term water quality pattern of water bodies. These networks often use compiled indicators (annual average concentration, maximum concentration, annual exported flux, etc.) calculated from a limited number of measurements. Infrequent measurements induce uncertainties on the indicator values. These uncertainties must be known to better interpret observed patterns. The objective of this article is to evaluate, using scientific approaches, uncertainties on nitrate indicators induced by infrequent sampling, and by the algorithms used to compute fluxes. A 50 year-basin data set of hourly to daily flow and concentration data gathered from nine watersheds (5 to 252 km2 in size) in Brittany, France, was analyzed to evaluate the uncertainties. Original data was numerically sampled to simulate common sampling frequencies including bimonthly, monthly and bimestrial frequencies. Water quality indicators (annual concentration average, maximum, median, 90th and 95th percentile and flux) calculated from the simulated samples were compared to the reference indicators calculated from the high frequency original data. Several algorithms proposed in the literature to calculate annual fluxes were tested. Results show that for all indicators, uncertainties increase as sampling intervals increase. Results also show that all the algorithms that do not use continuous flow data to compute nitrate fluxes yield very large uncertainties, even for biweekly sampling intervals, prompting the recommendation not to use these types of algorithms. Simulation results of watersheds with average hydrological reactivity show that monthly sampling procedures (typical sampling frequency in many monitoring networks) yield uncertainties ranging from 6 to +4 % for the annual average concentration indicator and uncertainties ranging from 12 to +11 % for the annual flux. The boundary values of the uncertainty ranges were found to be correlated to an indicator of hydrological reactivity of the watersheds. This flow duration indicator was the percentage of flow occurring in 2 % of the time corresponding to the highest flow. Using these correlations, guideline curves were drawn relating sampling frequencies, uncertainty levels and hydrological reactivity of watersheds. Using these curves, the general perception that average concentration and flux values obtained using the existing sampling scheme (monthly or bimestrial intervals) in the Brittany water quality monitoring networks are quite reliable is validated. However, uncertainties become very high for watersheds of high hydrological reactivity including artificially drained watersheds. The guideline curves offer for the first time a tool that can be used to optimize sampling schemes of surface water monitoring networks. This is particularly valuable in light of the tightening of existing monitoring scheme resulting from the implementation of the European Water Framework Directive.	water;brittany water;france
93	A methodological approach for a renewed upkeep of neglected rivers. In terms of water stream upkeep, only a global approach allows to better assess the environment sensitivities and the priorities to respect. As for the management of any other living system, it is necessary to maintain spaces of freedom, where nature can freely express itself, and which are in fact essential biological reservoirs. The author proposes here a simple research approach, which allows to localize, justify and limit river maintenance operations to what is absolutely necessary. The two essential steps of this method are the definition of the desirable river upkeep levels and the production of a detailed description in order to characterize its current upkeep status and the sanitary state of the riverside forestation. The comparative analysis of the desirable levels and of the actual situation assessment leads to a quick identification of the areas that require works, and then to the programming of these works.	river;neglected rivers;water
94	An approach to compare the cost, effectiveness and acceptability of farming practices respectful of the environment. To design the restoration plans requested by the EU Water Framework Directive, local regulators need to implement technically designed modifications of farming practices. Their main interest relies on the determination of which modifications are the most appropriate to the local conditions. To help this decision process, a selection grid has been built within the AgriBMPWater project (5th RTD Framework Program). The main interest of this grid is to allow the comparison of different “best management practices” regarding their environmental effectiveness, the associated costs and their acceptability. This paper presents the different steps of the method, some tools that have been used and their technical requirements, illustrates with some results the integrated tool that has been developed and provides keys for interpretation.	environment
95	An approach for spatializing the agricultural activities (RA-SPACE) with application to the calculation of a pesticide indicator at the Adour-Garonne district level in the Water Framework Directive implementation context. In the field of agri-environment, decision makers have to face a lack of operational methods useful for the implementation of public policies. The RA-SPACE method presented in this paper aims to provide a solution for transferring data from an administrative level to an environmental one and to describe the agricultural activities at the scale of the hydrographic unit (HU), in the context of the application of the Water Framework Directive (WFD). It is based on a GIS approach and on a statistical model and uses aggregation and breaking up tools, so that all the variables of the RA (Agricultural Census) would be recovered at the hydrological unit scale. This method has been applied to the calculation of a spatialised pesticide indicator at the Adour-Garonne district scale. The sensitive areas for pesticide pressure defined in this way were chosen by the River Basin Agency for the diagnosis phase of the implementation of the WFD.	pesticide;agricultural;environment
96	Agronomical use of sewage sludge from urban wastewater treatment: heavy metals in Zea mays plants. The Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive (91/271/EEC) aims to encourage the use of sludge whenever appropriate; the sewage sludge is a product of wastewater treatment which could find a reutilisation in the agricultural field. The necessity to find a solution to the sewage and biomass disposal has led to the development of techniques based on natural reuse of agricultural soils. In this way it represents, through a closed loop system, a source of all the nutritional elements, which has been removed by the agriculture. The sewage sludge application on soils represents an alternative to the traditional stock strategies; more convenient, from the economical point of view, than incineration or disposal in landfill, it also contributes to solve the sewage sludge recycling issue. The aim of this project is to grow up maize under experimental conditions, in order to evaluate the nutrients contribution of the sewage sludge on the final production, while observing the connection between application of sewage sludge and residual heavy metals concentration in the different plant parts.	sewage;sewage sludge;sludge recycling;sludge;agricultural;water
97	«Into the wild»: convergences between ecological and sociological perceptions of forest naturalness in Chartreuse (France). Naturalness is widely used to assess the conservation value of forest ecosystems. As this concept encompasses ecological as well as sociological aspects, we adopted an inter-disciplinary approach to our study of naturalness in two Chartreuse forests (one managed and one unmanaged). The aim was to know whether differences between the two forests assessed through measured ecological indicators and public perception converged. We translated scientific language into more easily accessible terms and then interviewed 30 visitors in each forest. Many ecological and sociological perceptions did converge, even though some scientific terms could not be fully transposed. The general public seems to be able to differentiate between degrees of naturalness. Involving them in forest conservation issues could enhance understanding and avoid potential conflict.	
98	The territorial analysis of truffle production: a prerequisite for biotechnical experimentation and a decision-making tool. The program of PSDR (for and on the regional development of the regions of Aquitaine and midi-pyrénées) research INGEDICO (Instruments of management and collective devices of conservation and recovery of naturals and renewable ressources) is a pluridisciplinary project associating human and biotechnical sciences. The first results allow us to analyze the territory of limestone hills to implement experimental bio-technological protocols to promote innovating environmental practices. Concretely, this territorial approach of truffle practices makes it possible to study the organization of actors and whether or not they contribute the preservation of these natural resources and landscape with their practices and to propose mobilizable instruments for a concerted management of limestone hills and ecosystems of truffles according to present environmental issues. This article presents us the first results concerning the regional Park of limestone hills in the Quercy (Lot, France).	limestone
99	Reforestation, successions of vegetation and model of the linear dynamics of forest growth. The abandoning of agricultural land and the consequent natural reforestation has been the main contributory factor in a significant increase in the wooded areas in France. The dynamics of these extensions can be evidenced by a study of plant successions. There are many theories regarding plant successions. We will limit our presentation to the basic concepts, categorised according to two approaches: a systemic approach on the one hand, and on the other hand, listing in order of importance, for each structural level of plant cover, the processes and factors which contribute to the forest dynamics. Using examples, we will attempt to highlight the most practical operational theories and the methods, which allow us to analyse and explain (at least partially) the dynamic phenomena (especially those concerning ligneous species). Finally, we will present some results, which we have selected from among the main regional linear forest dynamic models.	reforestation
100	Field survey: heavy metals and phosphorus accumulation in the soils of intensive livestock farms of Western Brittany. In Brittany (Western France) intensive pig, cattle and poultry breeding involves high amounts of some elements, such as minerals and metals. In particular, theoretical nutrient balance at farm scale level shows important excesses in phosphorus, potassium, copper and zinc. These elements come from chemical fertilizers and animal feed, and excesses affect chemical evolution of soils due to the addition of slurry. To study this enrichment, a survey of 64 breeding farms started in 1973, and 180 fields (3 per farm) were analysed every 3 years. The enrichment in P2O5 (Dyer), Cu-EDTA and Zn-EDTA has been correlated to the amounts of slurry spread on soils, cumulated over the past 20 years. There were no relationships between crops species or rotations and organic fertilization, the amounts of slurry beeing higher than crop requirements. Slurry and mineral phosphates appeared negatively correlated. A classification of fields based on cumulated inputs of slurry was established. Forthcoming analyses on total elements will be carried out to study the conditions of their migration and evaluate the risks of water pollution.	phosphorus;france;brittany;chemical evolution
101	Adaptation of a pesticide diagnosis method to the Poitou-Charentes region. The diagnosis of the risks of water pollution by pesticides is a current concern in Poitou-Charentes. In front of increasing demands of tools of diagnosis the GRAP Poitou-Charentes (Regional Group of Actions against Pesticides Pollution) decided to adapt to the region a diagnosis tool. The study conducted by the FREDEC Poitou-Charentes was lead by a working group including the GRAP members concerned by the subject: administrations, farmers' associations, agricultural technical institutes, pesticides sellers. First the GRAP decided to begin the study on the parcels level; the territorial level will be studied later. The CORPEN method was retained particularly because of the combined consideration of physical environment and pesticides practices and because of the farmer implication. The adaptation of the method concerned the creation of documents helping the diagnosis leading: methodological guide, report document. These documents were tested on 20 representative farms of the regional production systems and of the regional ground types. Other documents will be written to facilitate the diagnosis: pedological guide, possible proposed solutions.	pesticide;agricultural;farmers;water;fredec poitou charentes;grap
102	ADEAUMIS, a tool for estimating irrigation water demand on a regional scale - Example of use in times of crisis. The ADEAUMIS model has been developed in the context of southwestern France, where water management can be difficult during atypical years. It aims at estimating water demand for irrigation for the entire region. The estimation can be carried at any time, starting at the beginning of the irrigation period. To do so, ADEAUMIS couples a bio-decisional model and a geographical database. The credibility of ADEAUMIS was established by replaying the 1998 scenario. As a result, the water manager has used ADEAUMIS to help his decision making process since the hot and dry 2003 summer. ADEAUMIS is a combination of tools and methods for collecting input data, which can evolve toward more complex tools and methods. At the present, ADEAUMIS is being integrated into the tools used for the strategic water management of the Neste system, and may be used for tactical water management. Its use for long-term planning of water resources is under study.	water;irrigation water;irrigation;france
103	Applying fine bubble aeration to small aeration tanks. Because the aeration system in an activated sludge plant typically represents a large part of total energy requirements, designers and operators need accurate oxygen transfer information to make the aeration system as energy efficient as possible. This paper presents clean water tests performed at 38 wastewater treatment plants. The Specific Aeration Efficiency results (SAE, kgO2/kWh) are reported for: (1) large open channels (volume higher than 1000 m3), (2) small open channels, (3) total floor coverage cylindrical tanks, and (4) cylindrical tanks with grid arrangement. Some practical guidelines can be drawn, some of them being: (1) high SAE can be achieved at small aeration tanks (	efficient;aeration efficiency

106	Agriculture and tourism: two complementary activities for an original development of the high mountain pastures of the Vosges mountains. Moors have a particular position in the Vosges mountains, thanks to originals environment and socio economic context. So, their exploitation's service and their diversification are notable, because the first farms inns were operating at the end of the XIXth century. The farm of the vosgian moors is dedicated to the production of Munster cheese. Thanks to tourism, it can fully valorise its products in guest houses who are making the reputation of this area. After all, we must insist on the dynamism of this activity who both preserve pastoralism and landscapes, whose upkeep is necessary to carry out leisures and tourism.	agriculture
107	AIGA: a flood warning system for the entire hydrographic network. Presently, new flood forecasting schemes are being developed. On the one hand, there are streams for which real-time information on ground-level rainfall and flow rates are available, and on the other hand, there are the streams for which no real-time information on the flow rates is either actionable or available. Cemagref and Météo France have combined their skills to fill this gap and develop a tool to determine the amount of rain and the stream flow rate in real time on the entire French hydrographical network. AIGA produces a map of rain-related risks and a map of the hydrological risk, on a grid of 1 km2, every hour. This is produced even over geographical areas and streams with no specific instrumentation. We describe here the principles of operation of AIGA and we give examples of his capacity of forecast by supporting us on real events.	flood;aiga;rain
108	Improvement of sprinkling and water savings. This paper presents a method developed to supply advice on irrigation and improving irrigation system performance on the basis of agronomic, pedological and regional climate conditions, including especially wind factors. During 1994, the method was tested in two irrigated regions in France, Drôme and the Haute Garonne, which are subject to strong, frequent winds. The method provides significant enhancements to the practical advice provided on irrigation together with its degree of relevance.	irrigation;water
109	Improvement of shelter tubes protecting young trees from animals. Protecting young trees against domestic herbivores (livestock) or wild herbivores (deer) as well against rodents is a continuous preoccupation in all plantations. Various types of plastic tree protectors have been marketed recently. Results obtained by INRA and Cemagref have shown that Tubex protectors achieve a high level of protection against these animals. Unfortunately these tubes cause physiological modifications in the growth of the trees. The most visible effect is a substantial elongation of the leading shoot. This paper describes these physiological modifications and the attempt to reduce them by ventilating the tubes. It draws conclusions for their utilisation in future forestry and agroforestry plantations.	shelter tubes
110	Improving working methods for forest development plans: the experience of the Massif Central. Since 2000, the private forestry organisations have been developing a new method of forest development: the forest massif development plan (plan de développement de massif forestier or PDM in French). Limited in spatial extension, this development method aims at improving the management of the private forests through a collective and territorial approach. We conducted interviews with the foresters of the 5 regions of the Massif Central (France). Thus, we qualitatively assessed the current actions, the forces and the weaknesses of the method. Despite de differences in the approaches employed by the different regions, our study reveals common features. An efficient application of the development plan is hence based on: (i) a simple and quick diagnosis of the territory; (ii) an implication of the local actors (particularly the officials); (iii) a long-term animation concerted with economic actors. Nevertheless, a quantitative assessment would only be considered at least after 5 years of development planning.	private forests

114	A posteriori analysis of a Community Information System approach in a context of conflict: the case of irrigation in Charente. Irrigation in Poitou-Charentes exemplifies the tensions that exist between agriculture and other societal sectors. To overcome these conflicts, a Community Information System (CIS) for the purpose of both data management and community development has been set up in Charente by a group of policymakers, researchers and agricultural advisers. This paper describes our analysis of the differences among participants in the development of this CIS in terms of their points of view and expectations. Drawing on an analysis of a set of interviews conducted with these stakeholders in 2006, we propose a framework for use during the initial design phase of a CIS to make stakeholder expectations explicit and to promote a shared understanding prior to setting up a CIS.	agriculture;irrigation;researchers
115	Analysis method of the agriculture multifunctionality and application to a small livestock farming area. Because of the content diversity done to the multifonctionality of agriculture, it's generally difficult to objectivize and compare regards on several functions, in and between territories. The present work aims to define and to precise the limits of functions characteristics, such as expectation linked to a function, support-entity of a function, and achievement level of a function... The elaborated definitions constitute an analysis framework for the agriculture multifonctionality in a small livestock farm area. This application allows to reveal important differences of functions achievements in the whole area and in each farm of the area, linked to differences in spatial configurations of farms. It also allows to point for land-managers some elements of attention to sustain multifunctionality of farms area in livestock region.	agriculture
116	Experimental analysis of erosion mechanisms: superficial structural degradation and detachment of particles from cultivated soils. Crusting and erosion of cultivated soils result from aggregate breakdown and the detachment of soil fragments by rain, and the susceptibility of soil to these processes can be inferred from measurements of aggregate stability. Here, four main mechanisms (i.e. slaking, breakdown by differential swelling, mechanical breakdown by raindrop impact and physico-chemical dispersion) are defined. Their relative importance depends on the nature of the rain, as well as on the soilts physical and chemical properties. The relations between aggregate breakdown, crusting and water erosion were analysed. The effect of crust spatial variability and initial moisture content on infiltration and runoff are presented. The influence of slope steepness on runoff and erosion for a crusted interrill area and the detachment and transport processes involved in the interaction between slope, rain characteristics and plot size are also investigated.	rain;degradation
117	A spatial analysis method for agricultural-forest-urban interfaces. In the context of forest fire prevention, the Cemagref in Aix-en-Provence is developping, with remote sensing tools, a method of spatial analysis in cartography and characterization of the interfaces between wildland and urban areas. The aim of this study is to group zones having similar profiles with regard to fire risk exposure. The method described bellow was applied in south of France, in a very sensitive zone between Marseille and Aix-en-Provence. In a first part, we improved a supervised classification on orthophotos. We obtained very precise land use map. Then we analysed this map in a contextual mode in order to be able to describe different kind of vegetation (height, sparse...). Then we improved spatial analysis tools in order to describe the spatial organisation of the land use and specially houses organisation inside or near the forest. We used some indicators belonging to landscape ecology (fragmentation, diversity, density...). Finally, better charaterization and automatic cartography of these interfaces should, in the long run, enable them to be charaterized with regard to fire risk by integrating them into a complete fire risk evaluation model, in order to develop preventive actions.	urban areas;fire;agricultural

The goal of this paper is to present a state of the art of life cycle assessment of different sewage sludge treatment and to analyse the environmental impacts of different scenario of disposal and recycling routes of sewage sludge (landspreading, incineration). This study is a pre-necessary to a research project called ECODEFI (Ecodesign and development of assessment methods for innovative spreading technologies NRA program 2007-2010) conducted by Cemagref whose aim is to build a LCA simplified methodology for sewage sludge landspreading.	art;recycling;sewage
119	Geosynthetic anchorage trenches at the top of the slopes. Experimental studies and application. Geosynthetic lining system on slopes requires anchoring at the top of the bank. Depending on the space available at the top of the slope and on the applied load, the anchorage trench may take on different geometries. Various design methods have been proposed in this field but experimental and numerical studies showed that no single formula was capable of describing the behaviour of all types of anchorage, even though some were close to the experimental results in certain cases. To complete the existing studies, experimental tests were carried out on an anchorage facility and in-situ to highlight mechanisms and to determine the best anchorage trench for a fixed length of geotextile.

Knowing the land use of a region is an important issue for water managers since it is a key factor for estimating irrigation withdrawals. This paper presents an exploratory work, which involves sampled land use data from the Ter-Uti survey, exhaustive land use date from land survey and stochastic modelling of crop rotation rules. The limits of the present study, due to few case studies, are discussed, as well as the potentialities of the approach for managers and the opportunity offered by remote sensing for improving the proposed methodology.	water;irrigation

The aim of this paper is to estimate the level of nitrogen emissions (into the air and water compart¬ments) that can result from the adoption of alternative farming practices and manure management. The modelling has been tested on three breeding watersheds in the Western part of France. The framework that we developed includes a GIS connected with, on the one side, softwares which design scenarios for farming practices and on the other side a continuously distributed agro-hydrological model. The results on these three watersheds emphasize that the total annual nitrogen load that is emitted into the air (N2 and N2O) and into the water (nitrate) has the same magnitude than the annual mineral N surplus. The model has estimated the mean emission index for N2O at a 5 % of the inputs level, which is significantly higher than the coefficients that are usually used for these emissions. The total loads into the atmosphere are as important from cultivated soils on the unsaturated area in the watersheds than from riparian areas. Management strategies that are the simplest and the more likely to be accepted by the farmers have proven to decrease the total N loads at the outlet of the watershed by 25 % after 21 simulated years. For the studied watershed, this decrease is high enough to attain nitrate concentrations below 50 mg/l, but not below 25 mg/l. The optimised management strategies reduce the emissions into the air from 12 to 20 % when compared to the current farming practices. The model predicts that these results cannot be attained before at least 10 years of improved management. As a consequence, the environmental evaluation of better management practices requests at least some ten years. Evaluating the sustainability of the newly designed systems also request to consider at the same time the use of soil and the agronomic and hydrodynamic characteristics of the system. In other words, the risks of pollution displacements from one compartment to the other have to be evaluated too.	water;watershed;agricultural
122	Use of geomembranes for hydraulic concrete works. Geomembranes offer numerous advantages for concrete works waterproofing mainly in the following cases: works in seismic areas, concrete designed not waterproof, renewal of works with active cracks. This paper presents the new French regulation (Fascicule 74, Edition 1998). Some case histories are also studied, to point out the main elements to be considered during design and construction. Those points are used by a working group of the French Geosynthetics Committee (CFG) to write guidelines fort use geomembrane to waterproof concrete works.	concrete;hydraulic concrete
123	Application of a new method for assessing deer damage in forests: towards a diagnosis of their silvicultural impact. A survey of deer (Capreolus capreolus, Cervus elaphus) damage to commercial forestry was carried out in 5 French regions. Browsing damage by deer on a large sample (n = 638) of vulnerable stands (planted and naturally regenerated) was recorded during 1999 using standard field measurement techniques. The main regenerated tree species were: oaks, beech, maritime pine, Douglas fir, silver fir ...We tried to set guidelines for an objective diagnosis of the future development of each inspected stand. Our evaluation was based on the number of undamaged or slightly damaged species, which was compared to the target value. Using this procedure, the stands were classified into 3 categories according to the silvicultural goal: not affected, temporarily or definitively affected. An analysis of the causes that led to the observed situation was carried out in order to detect the responsibility of deer compared to other factors. Results are discussed for our total sample and for 2 specific naturally-regenerated study sites which were more or less heavily grazed by deer. The impact of ungulates depends on the forest management, the species composition, the browsing tolerance of plants and the duration of the browsing pressure. Forecasting browsing damage effect appears to be more difficult in natural regeneration than in artificial regeneration. Variations in the density and the height of the seedlings in a same stand and the causes of a lack of seedlings explain the difficulty in evaluating game damage. These diagnoses were based on certain assumptions but still provide the managers with a useful tool for an objective assessment of damage. Other indicators and long-term studies are needed to support objective judgements.	deer;silvicultural impact
124	Contribution of remote sensing to hydrological modelling. Different studies have shown how the soil moisture state influences the behaviour of the basin rainfall-runoff relationship. After being assimilated in hydrological models, this variable may improve outflow forecasting methods on agricultural river basin. Now, several surface parameters, like soil moisture, which allow to follow the soil water budget, may be inferred from space remote sensing. The present paper reports on an investigation in central Brittany (France) using radar and optical remotely sensed data. Ground truth data have been compared with ERS-1/SAR data at the basin scale. The results confirm the capability of monitoring surface soil moisture during the periods of low vegetation density with the space-borne ERS-1/SAR. The second aspect of the project is the development of a hydrological model taking into account soil and vegetation cover to simulate soil moisture and outflows. The results of the simulation are generaly in good agreement with the measurements, the assimilation of combinated remote sensed data in the model is in progress in order to validate the methodology. The possibility of application of this methodology in operational hydrology is discussed.	moisture;agricultural river;forecasting;water
125	Contributions of information technology for livestock effluent spreading management. Management of land application of livestock manure implies the collection of an important amount of data. Our paper examines the different electronic on board systems available for this purpose. Spatial information regarding the waste management plan can be provided by the means of a GPS. When dealing with solid manure, the main difficulties will occur for determination of spread quantities. For liquid manure, determination of slurry dilution will be the major difficulty. We have established a data collection system which may constitute an integrated book-recording management. This system may be useful at different levels. The field level will constitute the basic element of an information system. This information system can be dedicated to a farm or to a specific geographic area. Information technology may enable the management of a common databank. A multipartner geographical information system implies the use of a common data dictionary and exchange formats.	
126	Contribution of a geographical information system for the localisation of areas at risk of pollution by pesticides. The contamination of surface and underground water by phytosanitary substances used in farming induces the administrators of aquatic resources to implement policies for restoring the quality of water. In cooperation with the AQUALIS engineering office, the Loire-Bretagne Water Board has developed a method, which provides help in determining preventive strategies for the qualitative management of surface and underground water. This consists of setting up a territorial area in order to localize the sectors responsible for a pollution risk. Zoning is carried out using a Geographic Information System, by crossing factors, which lead to sensitivity to the mobilization and entrainment of phytosanitary molecules used in crop management. With respect to surface water management, the zoning maps are completed by an approach, which identifies the land-area controlled by runoff barriers. This second part enables one to assess the consequences on the runoff transfer of pollution, which is generated in risk-prone areas.	water;zoning
127	Use of numerical modelling for the study of organic waste spreading equipment. The large development observed in the field of numerical modelling contributes to the study and the design of numerous equipments. The aim of this research work is to implement a CFD software and examine the results in comparison with experimental data. The flow behaviour has been analysed inside the tank and on the spinning disk of a pasty sewage sludge spreader. The results show that the phenomena were well described by the numerical modelling. Many applications can be developed once the simulation parameters will be correctly established.	research
128	Theoretical approach for the development of a sustainability indicator for an agricultural production process. In this paper, we pursue two purposes. First, we show how essential is a positive approach of the agriculture multifunctionality perceived as a rationale for the sustainability of the agricultural production processes. Second, on this basis, we construct a sustainability indicator applied to a joint production.	agriculture
129	Global approaches to estimating torrential erosion - inputs from sloping land and sediment production . The mountain streams are characterized by an important solid transport during floods. The materials are provided by the erosion processes occurring within the whole catchment. The knowledge of these processes and their quantification is an important point for engeneers studying torrential risks. This paper is restrained to the field of low spatial scales, where someone can observe processes with naked eye; they are considered in a global and integrating way. The disciplinary field of torrential erosion is complementary for torrential hydraulics and hydrology. It may be shared in 2 sections: slope sediment supplies and sediment yield. This paper would aim at presenting basic knowledge and engeneering methods. Flood is the integrating phenomenon connecting material fluxes: sediment supplies provided by slopes may reach the channel and are available for transportation by immediate or differred flows. Solid transport may be carried out as bedload transport or debris-flow. Geomorphology allows to situate actual erosion on a time scale and to assess if the considered catchment knows equilibrium or crisis. It helps when listing relevant processes and factors in a given study. The data on torrential erosion are rare. On slopes, each erosion process have his own rythm and fluxes are intermittent. Processes take turns to carry materials. Quantify slope sediment supply is very difficult. Some methods are suggested. Sediment yield is not the sum of slope sediment supplies: the reason are explicited. Some empirical and conceptual models may help prediction. Validation is a critical point.	floods;sediment;erosion
130	"Wastewater treatment, constructed wetlands and lagooning: feedback from Europe. Extensive wastewater treatment techniques using artificial marshes and natural lagooning are widely used around the world in very different contexts. The relatively simple operating constraints associated with the robustness of their operation and the quality of the effluent they deliver are conferring them a growing scientific interest. The success of the conferences organised jointly by the IWA (International Water Asoosciation) and ASTEE (Scientific and Technical Association for Water and the Environment) in Avignon in September 2004 confirms this. However, the design modes and the mechanisms involved are different for each family of systems (e.g. vertical or horizontal flow filters, mixed systems). This special issue of Ingénieries-EAT brings together 10 articles presenting a ""state of the art"" in Europe and France. Their dissemination within the community of water stakeholders in France can enrich the reflections of scientists and consultancies in order to further increase their use, if necessary through the association of sectors that are currently little used in France."	wetlands;water;environment;wastewater;europe
131	Association of natural lagoons and infiltration-percolation: pilot test results and perspectives. Many small French communities have been equipped with Waste Stabilisation Ponds. Their effluent quality is relatively good for N and P but is known to be poor regarding organic matter. Pilot trials show that it is possible to decrease 50 % of the outlet SS and to obtain an additional nitrification thanks to one additional filtration on a 25 cm sand height. The follow-up of a self-priming siphon shows its capacity to function with only 1 cm height of tidal range. The owner of Aurignac accepted to built a demonstration WSP plant, followed by Intermittent Sand Filters. The primary sludge, which accumulates at the inlet of the 1st pond will be spread each day on four Sludge Dewatering Reed Bed Filters. He submitted in November 2001 this project (capacity of 300 PE) to the EEC in the LIFE-environment program. This paper gives the results of pilot trials and of the siphon functioning. It explains the demonstration plant design basis and explains our objectives.	tidal;natural lagoons;association
132	Avalanches: national expenditure on prevention. Avalanches are on a long term basis the natural phenomenon that takes the highest toll in terms of human life in the Alpine countries and France is no exception. A significant prevention program was set up after the Val-d'Isère accident in 1970, involving the creation of research and coordination bodies, the allotment of new funds for avalanche mapping and forecasting. It is all the more surprising that never was any attempt made to assess what these measures cost to France as a territory, i.e. to the tax payer and also to the customer (who can be a foreign citizen). When investigating such a new domain, it is necessary to have limited ambitions. This means one can only hope to get at magnitudes of global costs. One the other hand, some simplification arise from the fact it is not necessary to make detailed calculations, especially whenever the activity that is considered seems not to involve big expenses. The most important is to first carry out an inventory of all activities that imply some expenses and of all actors who are taking part in these activities, at least those actors who produce statistical and economical data. Whenever an activity is deemed as central in terms of cost and no statistical source exist, a specific survey has to be set up. Working along these guidelines, the main activities were identified as.	alpine;avalanches
133	"Nitrogen, phosphorus and pesticides. Strategies and prospects for reducing fluxes. This special issue is the result of the scientific and technical day ""Nitrogen, phosphorus and pesticides: New strategies for reducing upstream flows"", organised by the joint research unit "" Centre for Plant Ecology and Hydrology "" (Strasbourg National School of Water and Environmental Engineering/Université Louis Pasteur.) and ASTEE (Scientific and Technical Association for Water and the Environment), in Strasbourg on 8 February 2007. The aim here is to make the knowledge gained from recent research work available to all those involved in environmental management. Four articles are first of all devoted to the transfer mechanisms, interests and limits of strategies to reduce nitrate, phosphorus and pesticide flows in watersheds. Two articles then analyse the processes involved and the optimisation of constructed wetlands with a view to reducing pesticide flows. Finally, two articles present the approach for designing operational tools to assess the impact of agricultural practices on water quality in non-instrumental agrosystems not equipped with sensors , in the form of pesticide transfer risk indicators on the one hand, and the Territ'eau methodology developed in Brittany on the other."	pesticides;water;environment;nitrogen
134	The La Muratte dam. Waterproofing by PVC geomembrane. Technical feedback. The waterproofing of the upstream face of the La Muratte gravity Dam, 100 years old, has been improved by adding a lining: PVC geomembrane + geotextile + synthetic mesh. The works took place during the summer 2004. One of the major issues at the site was the treatment of the ends of the lining (treatment of the edges on side and at the toe of the lining). The preparation in advance of the works is important. Both the contractor and the engineer in charge are involved in this key task during the detailed design stage, during the release of the method statement and the choice and adaptation of tools.	
135	"Dams and risks. Risk zero does not exist. That is nowadays the language of truth used by the engineer. But, until now, this language is often hard to understand by the public. After a recall of the definition of risk and its use in the dam area, the report presents the seven contributions to this session, dealing with four aspects: - the alea, - the extreme scenario, that means dam rupture, - risks with dam operation, - hydraulic structures, in the aim of reducing flood risk. The main conclusion is that information to the public and negotiation are hereafter the keys of this ""culture of risk"" which must accompany our sustainable development politics."	
136	Assessment of 10 years of use of geosynthetic sealing devices in French navigable canals. Sealing devices using geomembranes and similar products have been implemented over the last ten years in the rehabilitation of navigable canals. This article describes seven examples, in the north and east of France, six using bituminous geomembranes and one a bentonite synthetic material. The support structures are very different. On the other hand, the protective structure, consisting of concrete slabs cast in situ, is identical at the six sites using a geomembrane.	canals;france
137	"Assessment of landscape definitions and evaluation methods. The term ""landscape"" is sometimes used loosely and sometimes in a highly specialised sense. It currently applies to very specific concerns of our society, which are difficult to assess. This paper sets out a brief assessment of the definitions of the word as well as the methods of evaluating landscape as an expression of the relationship between space and nature. The paper concludes that, in addition to the ""key areas"" of our landscape heritage, the ""ordinary landscape"" should also be studied."	
138	Efficiency of the performance of selective collection of packaging and biowaste for a peri-urban commune: the Villedieu du Clain community of municipalities. The efficiency of the collection for the Community of Communes of the Villedieu du Clain was studied. The aim was to compare the initial situation established in 1999 and the last one of 2002 after one year of separate collection for packagings and biowastes. Two individual containers of 120 liters are provided for the separate collection of packagings and biowastes. Differents indicators for quality of products, participation of users and performance of collection have been measured. We compared results between two periods. For this Community, we note more than 50 % of house wastes are recycled. The separate collection for packagings, biowastes, glasses and newspapers absorbed the rise of house wastes quantities and reduced residual house wastes quantities placed in landfill. The users participate more and better to the packagings than biowastes collection. The separate collection for packagings reduced the packagings quantities in the residual house wastes placed in landfill. This impact is not so significant for biowastes. The collection represents 38 % whereas the drop-off center receives 53% of wastes.	efficiency
139	Assessment of the Turkey-France-Switzerland project on the fight against the risks of avalanches. After two very snowy winters had taken well over five hundred lives, Turkey made the decision to build a long term avalanche mitigation program with France and Switzerland as partners. The main object of this program was to shift from a resettlement policy to a preventive policy. The program lasted 3 years, with two main parts : avalanche forecasting using meteorological monitoring and avalanche mapping and zoning based on GIS. To make the program more realistic and more concrete, it was carried out as a pilot project in a rather large region, located along the Black Sea. The program brought forth very positive scientific and technical results thanks to the quality of the Turkish team that was set up in Ankara. Its practical implementation will be carried on by Turkey, building on the new groundwork legal and practical procedures that contribute to natural hazard mitigation, taking advantage of the rapid evolution of the country.	turkey;switzerland;turkey france switzerland;france
140	Socio-economic and cultural assessment of the implantation of dams. The construction of dams in France during the fertile period of the Thirty Glorious Years did not give rise to any opposition likely to call them into question. It was the victory of the ideal of modernity in line with the aspirations of French society that enabled the developer to achieve this result. On the other hand, changes were made to the initial - generally unique - goals assigned to these works, such as energy production, meeting domestic or irrigation water needs, and flood control. Tourism around the reservoirs is the most significant new use that has emerged since the dams were put into service. It represents an important economic stake for the municipalities bordering the works. To a lesser extent, the support of low-water levels is also an increasing challenge. These new uses may come into conflict with the initial uses, especially in periods of drought, which requires learning and strong consultation between all water users.	water;implantation
141	Biology of macrophytes with potential for proliferation. Management of water-bodies affected by prolific growths of plants pose several problems related to the assessment of the intensity of these phenomena which should be considered on both spatial and temporal scales. An inventory of the most relevant plants, called risk species, has been produced, after an examination of invading growths recorded on the French hydrographic system. These plants are belonging to different macrophyte groups such as macro-algae, native hydrophyte phanerogams as Ranunculus sp., Potamogeton sp., Myriophyllum sp., Ceratophyllum sp., Lemna sp., and introduced phanerogams such as Elodea sp., Lagarosiphon sp., Ludwigia sp., Myriophyllum aquaticum. Some helophyte plants have also been considered. Their biological strategies determine their proliferation potential by developing high growth and substantial propagation abilities, through special morphological and physiological features, and means of vegetative reproduction. A best knowledge of their competitive strategies, of often perturbed environmental conditions, and of factors which can favour this capacity, allow to bring practical data as a support of any choice to control these plants and to manage concerned aquatic environments.	biology;algae
142	Biology and ecophysiology of macrophytes. Aquatic environments are subjected to high physical and chemical variations (water level, turbidity, temperature, light, salinity, nutrients). Hydrophytes respond to these variations with great morphological and physiological plasticity, which allows them to adapt to heterogeneous environments, whether spatial or temporal. Assemblages of biological traits confer strategies of regeneration and colonisation, depending on the constraints or disruptions. Thus we show 1) that vegetative reproduction is especially prevalent among macrophytes, therefore facilitating the recolonization after disturbance, 2) Plasticity of biological traits is almost a rule among macrophytes, and is demonstrated in many species in response to hydraulic and trophic constraints and to disturbances by floods. Plants respond to variations in the trophic level by phosphorus accumulation, which depends on species, season and conditions of mineralization environment. Enzymatic activities are modified in the plant: this is the case of nitrate-reductase inhibited by ammonia nitrogen.	reproduction;floods;biology;aquatic environments

This special issue reviews the situation and the scientific knowledge.

144	CAN-bus on agricultural machinery: information technology at the service of precision agriculture and traceability. Electronic architecture on agricultural mobile equipment will be significantly re-designed thanks to a field bus used for automation purposes in factories: the CAN-bus. Due to its special features, the CAN-bus will be widely used for both mobile and stationary applications (e.g. cars, trucks and ships). Thanks to the CAN-bus, tractors and implements will be able to interchange many kinds of data sets. This will be a way to control implements from the tractor's driver interface so called Virtual Terminal -and also to automatically collect data needed for management. The integration of the CAN-bus on agricultural mobile equipment will constitute a means to carry out the major part of what is needed for precision agriculture and traceability purposes. But this will be really efficient only if manufacturers use the same international standard, in order to design equipment able to interchange data.	agricultural;bus
145	Accounting framework for agri-environmental policy expenditure in the Aquitaine region. A tool to facilitate evaluation procedures. The approach proposed in this article is that of a financial balance sheet for expenses scheduled for the protection of water from farm pollution. As such, the main agro-environmental programs implemented in Aquitaine between 1994 and 1996 are listed and examined. The preparation of an initial inventory of these expenses is necessary, although insufficient, in order to analyze and study the costs to be paid by society in order to preserve and restore the quality of water. At the same time, establishing a cost-analysis framework provides one with a tool, which facilitates the approaches involved in the economic assessment of agro-environmental programs. From a methodological point of view, the cost-analysis framework, which has been set up is based on environmental « satellite » accounts and is designed to answer three main questions: « How much is spent every day for the protection of water from farm pollution? Which organizations finance these programs? Who benefits from them? ».	water;accounting
146	Camargue, a formidable challenge for the enviornment and democracy. The project to build a bridge near the mouth of the Rhône, the first stage of a direct road link between Marseille and Montpellier going along the coast right through the Camargue, has aroused a wave of opposition amongst local inhabitants and environmental conservationists. This adverse reaction has led to the project being placed in abeyance. However, the proposed project has highlighted the importance of the issues, which affect this region. The regional decision-making bodies facing field problems as well as economical constraints and major environmental watters were in a position mainly characterized by short term issues. However, the overriding policy affecting environmental protection is of sense only in the long term. The incompatibility between these two policies is very real in Camargue because of the considerable financial flows in this region. It appears to be necessary to undertake new measures to ensure lasting protection of the Camargue whereby nature, acknowledged for its value to future generations, will cease to be of commercial value and become a common treasure in the same way as the Louvre or the Arles Arenas. The water law (January 1992) introduces the first legal support for these measures but it is still tentative. Practical procedures for achieving the measures still have to be drawn up: the Camargue is worthy of this attention.	camargue

148	Autecological and silvicultural characterisation of precious hardwoods. A bibliographic study was made of the autecology of four hardwoods (ash, wild cherry, sycamore and Norway maple) to produce a summary of the state of knowledge. The many documents consulted revealed a general indication of the requirements of these valuable hardwoods relating to their environment but rarely gave any precise values. The ash, wild cherry, sycamore and Norway maple require particular conditions, a good water supply, abundant food and a large amount of space but they do not tolerate badly drained, compact soil. These species are silviculturally demanding. Young trees often need considerable care, followed by very active silviculture to produce the high quality wood greatly in demand by the furniture and interior decoration industries. Despite numerous similarities, each of these hardwoods has its own particular relationship with its environment. Ash is especially demanding for water, the wild cherry is very sensitive to the compactness of the soil and prone to root asphyxiation but more drought resistant. The large maples grow well in cold areas with high air humidity. Our courrent knowledge of the growing conditions for ash, wild cherry, sycamore and Norway maple is not yet sufficiently precise to determine reliably the extent to which these hardwoods can be used for forestry and reforestation.	water;autecological
149	Characterisation of the droplet size distribution of a sprinkler using an optical method. When evaluating irrigation sprinklers, radius of throw is the first parameter considered for defining spacing and overlapping between adajacent sprinklers. This represents only part of the characteristics of water application quality. An impact sprinkler applies water on a discontinuous mode, varying intensity and droplet size with radius and hydraulic operating conditions. Droplet size distribution determines the sensitivity of sprinkler watering to wind and its impact on soil structure. The following paper presents a measurement sensor and a method for characterising a sprinkler from droplet size distribution measurement. The method lays on the assumption that i) log-normal probability functions can fit droplet distribution at different positions along the radius, ii) distribution parameters can be adjusted on 90% of the radius for all nozzle diameters and operating pressures for one sprinkler type. This method applies for a wide range of hydraulic conditions of the sprinkler in use. It can be used to predict the effects of irrigation on soil surface and the sensitivity of the distribution to wind. Using this characterising method it can be possible to select sprinkler types and functioning parameters compared to soil and climate characteristics. Inversely it is possible from several measurements to characterise a sprinkler droplet distribution model and to determine ranges of functioning pressure or nozzle type selection.	water;irrigation;wind;sprinkler;irrigation sprinklers
150	Significant characteristic of drainage geocomposite: transmissivity. Drainage is the elimination of excess water contained in soil. Accordingly, it favors the decrease and control of interstitial pressure, the control of intermittent output and the consolidation of soils. Geocomposites are widely used for drainage applications. Like all geosynthetic materials, their hydraulic and mechanical properties are measured in the laboratory. However, can these values be obtained on site?	water;drainage
151	Mapping assessment of the soil ability to disperse treated wastewater. The choice of the adapted wastewater treatment systems in the rural areas takes into account many considerations as well technical as environmental, the concern of the discharge of the treated wastewater is one of those. The soil constitutes one of the two principal ways to discharge treated wastewater, with the surface water bodies. The need arises to have, for the Walloon Region (Belgium), a map assessing the soil capacity to disperse treated water. Indeed, the factors that influence the water dispersion in the soil are numerous and are not always easily understood by practical people. The purpose of the work presented here is to propose an evaluation method of the soil ability for the underground dispersion of treated wastewater, by a cartographic document, which covers the Walloon territory. The map is an application of the Soil Map of Belgium, it translates pedological information to answer a precise question: up to what extent is the soil ready to evacuate treated wastewater by a small wastewater treatment system?	water;evacuate;mapping;wastewater
152	Cartography and use of wheat foliar index from radiometric data acquired by tractor-mounted sensors. Estimating the leaf area index of wheat along the crop cycle allows to answer two important purposes: (i) to be able to predict the crop nitrogen needs by using measurements from early stages; (ii) to use the green leaf area along the whole cycle in order to establish, by means of previous soil and yield maps, a diagnosis on the state of the crop from the intrafield heterogeneousness observed. With this aim in view, a georeferenced radiometrical data system, mounted on a tractor was finalized. The system is made up of (i) four twin-channels radiometers (red and near infrared), mounted on a 9m-long boom and measuring the reflected light by the canopy, plus an hemisphere viewing radiometer measuring the incident light, (ii) an electronic interface, and (iii) a computer for data acquisition and storage. Geopositioned data were acquired at 3 dates over a 15 ha field where non uniform agronomical factors were applied. The data were used to cartography the multidate GLAI after anthesis. A linear model explaining the GLAI was tested (r2=0.87). The soil factor was found as having the most important contribution to the data variance. Globally the acquisition and processing methodology prooved its ability to deliver pertinent spatial and temporal information on crop in order to control the growth or post-anthesis vegetation status.	
153	Multi-risk mapping: a semi automatic method. This paper aims at explaining how to set a semi automatic multi risk cartography. We designed an application from the software ARSEN, which integrates the vulnerability and the hazards to create real risk maps. ARSEN was designed by the ETNA division. It's a generic tool dedicated to spatial data representation. It allows you to reach, under the same system both hazard and vulnerability of risks.	software;mapping
154	Flood fields and aerial photographs: determination of submersion heights. Over the centuries, the construction of several dikes has created a highly complex water circulation system in alluvial plains. The management of these ageing dikes, in particular understanding how they interact with flooding and the associated risks, is now a major consideration in land improvement work in alluvial plains. A method was drawn up to study in detail aerial flood photographs to provide information on the area covered by occasional flooding (area of water) over the whole of the dikes. This method was part of, and additional to, hydrogeomorphological studies and hydromodelling systems. It was developed in the lower Hérault valley and provided additional information about occasional flooding showing the actual role played by the dikes during the floods. It is the first stage towards flood risk management in alluvial plains.	flood;water
155	Nozzle selection and management of pivot irrigation - taking into account the soil infiltration capacity. Centre pivots or moving laterals are able to perform a very uniform irrigation. One of the obstacles to the extension of such systems is the very high intensity of the irrigation they distribute . It can exceed some soil infiltration capacity. The main factors that characterize pivot irrigation for a given plot are reviewed: types of sprinklers, nozzles, functioning pressure range, wind resistance, droplet diameters. These elements allow to compute the maximum value of the applied watering intensity by a given sprinkler type. The water application curves obtained are then compared to the soil infiltration curves to select the appropriate types of sprinkler. The influence of the daily application and sprinkler range on watering intensity is illustrated and discussed. A graphical method is proposed for assessing the maximum amount of irrigation water avoiding runoff. Additional information is given on water application intensity calculation, standardisation, market evolution, system cost, and on the WPDiBus software, used to compute and diagnose the functioning of devices designed by Cemagref. A brief literature review is provided.	water;irrigation water;irrigation;pivot irrigation;sprinkler
156	Coexisting with breeding activities: synthesis on pig farming to understand the environmental issues. Piggeries produce effluents, which contribute to the degradation of water, soil and air quality. The environmental impacts of emissions from piggeries are generally known: phosphorous build-up in the soil from repeated manure applications leading to eutrophication, and emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide contributing to the greenhouse effect. However, the impact of heavy metals on the environment and health risks associated with pig manure (and their estimation) are less documented. Regardless of the environmental impact, reducing pollution at its source should be considered the best approach to limit the environmental impact from pig production. Solutions to reduce emissions of pollutants are proposed: existing or under development. These measures, which concern the whole livestock system can require a change in animal nutrition (reduction of nitrogen, phosphorus, heavy metals), the use of covers for slurry stores (GHG, ammonia) or biological, chemical or physical treatment of effluent (nitrogen, phosphorus).	environment;pig;animal;piggeries;carbon dioxide
157	How to quantify the phenomenon of spontaneous reforestation: an inventory of the inventories at the national level. From their physical appearance as well as from the dynamic landscape and ecological viewpoints, the extensions of forests form an intermediate space between fallow land - in the broad sense - resulting from the abandoning of cultivated or grazing land and the forest proper. Like the moors and fallow lands, these extensions are hard to define and vary depending on the morphological, historical or socio-economic criteria used. This hard to define category of space is thus left out of the various inventories available concerning the use of land over the national territory, even though the latter clearly show, over time, the transfer of areas from cultivated land to forest. It is thus necessary to cross-check the data to form an idea of the phenomenon and its distribution in space over the national territory.	
158	How to reduce irrigation withdrawals in a cost-effective way? Results from a foresight and economic analysis in two river basins in the south of France. This article illustrates the economic analysis applying promoted by the European Water Framework Directive. It presents the methodology and the results based on the applying to agricultural use of water in two river basins in the south of France where water shortages occurs regularly. The future withdrawals for irrigation in 2020 are assessed by a foresight approach and a cost-effective analysis is then performed. Results at several scales allow to identify the most effective measures to save water. The unit cost of these measures could be compared to the unit cost of others measures like new water resource mobilization to help water stakeholders in their planning.	water;irrigation;agricultural;france;river
159	How to regulate agricultural abstraction of groundwater? A case study on the Roussillon aquifer.  In order to determine the best adapted economic tools to manage diffuse agricultural water withdrawals, a research in three steps is presented in this article: firstly, surveys (in Roussillon plain located in South of France) allow to improve the representation of withdrawers' behaviour and to test their reactions against some economic instruments. Secondly, a conceptual model is built, allowing determining theoretical impact of different instruments. Thirdly, these theoretical predictions are tested in laboratory with naïve subjects to evaluate empirically, in a controlled environment, the performance of these instruments.	agricultural;agricultural water;research
160	How to valorise aerial photos in GIS?. The fast progress of microcomputers has made available new mass storage capacities and new techniques of image processing. Users of aerial photographs have now access to friendly softwares, allowing the integration of these images in a digital environment. These tools allow to orthorectify aerial photographs to integrate them in Geographical Information Systems. This technical note provides some technical background concerning orthorectification and the software, hardware and data necessary to accomplish this task, and presents a study based on this technique aimed at following forest cover evolution at the watershed scale.	
161	Communication and agricultural equipment - From embedded system to wireless ad hoc network to integrate agricultural equipment in the extended information systems. In an agricultural, environmental and economical context in full evolution, new agricultural stakes related to the follow-up of the practices and productions arise. More and more information relating to the practices and the productions are necessary. The use of new communication and information technologies makes it possible to answer these needs. With the development of the wired or wireless communication networks (ISObus on agricultural equipment, Bluetooth, Wifi) for the connections between equipment, the acquisition and the communication of the data become easy and automatic. Thus, the management and the use of the data collected in space reference information systems can be set up gradually. After a history recalling the evolution of the embedded electronics on agricultural equipment and the communication area network starting with ISO11783 or ISOBus specifications, this paper accounts the CAN ISOBus implementation level on agricultural equipment shown at SIMA 2003 (Paris) and the opportunities about a network realisation with agricultural equipment.	evolution;agricultural
162	Communicating on floods: propositions for using an interactive educational small-scale model. We designed a small-scale schematic catchment model for a science exhibition open to all, for disseminating knowledge about flood generation, defining notions like vulnerability and hazard, and for observing the results and the limits of structural mitigation measures. This successful experience may be fitted for communicating on real-life development projects, provided it is adapted to the client's objectives and the audience's expectations. However, such a catchment model is not an accurate and comprehensive scale model and can only reproduce qualitative properties of streamflows. Keeping that in mind, we further investigate three potential uses: supporting discussion within a small group, helping communicating on an on-going study, and displaying features of a detailed project.	floods
163	In-situ comparison of the performance of clay and geosynthetic clay liners in landfill covering. Different capping systems are studied at an experimental MSW landfill, since 1997. Two types of covers, with clay and with geosynthetic clay liner (GCL) are tested and compared in order to study hydrous, thermic and mechanical behaviours. This paper presents the information relative to the comparison between GCL and clay liner performances,	
164	Complementarity or equivalence of natural and synthetic materials for the waterproofing of landfills?. The French regulation concerning municipal waste storage defines materials to be used to insure watertightness of landfills. It also allows replacing these materials by others, providing these are shown to be equivalent and give the same security considering water resource pollution risks. Different waterproofing materials and mainly geomembranes and geosynthetic clay liners are presented together with their advantages and disadvantages when used at the bottom of landfills. Equivalency is then discussed, based on different research results. Two comparisons are made: the first between clay and geosynthetic clay liner, and the second between geomembrane and clayey barriers. It is shown that equivalency is not demonstrated yet. Indeed, it seems that at present, based on scientific evidences, materials composing barriers as defined by the regulation cannot be replaced by other materials.	water;natural
165	Long-term behaviour of geotextiles and geomembranes. Geotextiles installed in many geotechnical and environmental works must have a short term performance in retaining sol particles, filtering liquids, be a separator between sols, protect geomembrane against puncture and accomplish many other functions. Geomembranes are specified as impermeable liners to install in landfill cells to retain leachates and in lagoons to store industrial liquids. Their short-term performance, survivability, is related to the engineering design of the work and to the CQA manufacture and installation. It is also expected that they will have a service life, a durability, exceeding the waste degradation period. How long will a geotextile or a geomembrane last, expected service life, when installed in an earth structure and in contact with climatic conditions and chemical products?	
166	Behaviour of grey poplars and aspen hybrids in young plantations. Adaptability and yield of 35 hybrid clones of Leuce poplars are analysed in various environmental experiments led by Cemagref; they show that these hybrids are not productive enough for intensive poplar plantations in valleys, and seldom valuable for extensive forest management because they do not root easily.	
167	Behaviour of geomembranes in French embankment dams.  France has been one of the most active countries in the development of geomembrane based facings (GBF) for embankment dams. Therefore it is interesting to draw lessons from the feedback on this portfolio of dams, whose oldest are now more than thirty years old. This paper does that on three topics: ageing study of geomembranes through in situ samples and laboratory tests, global efficiency of the GBF through evolution of leakage measurements, qualitative aspects through visual inspection. It can be concluded that, if well designed and placed, these GBF have a very satisfactory behaviour.	france
168	Hydraulic behaviour of a geosynthetic clay liner in three wastewater lagoons. Three wastewater lagoons were lined thanks to a geosynthetic clay liner (GCL) containing natural sodium bentonite confined thanks to argilo-calcarous soil containing silex. Leaks were detected as soon as water was introduced into the ponds. The various explanations are puncturing and weakness of the confining layer. The study performed showed that the hydraulic conductivity and swelling index of the bentonite evolved at the contact of the calcareous soil. This phenomenon itself allows explaining the rate of leakage obtained. Nonetheless, the use of soils containing puncturing elements is not consistent with the state of the art and has to be forbidden.	water
169	Storage design and batch management of sewage sludge spread in agriculture. A well-made design of sewage sludge storage is a key-factor for the success of land application operations. Too often, this step is a weak link that forbids a right agronomic management of fertilisation and sludge-treated soils. This article has been written by a committee of engineers in order to investigate the numerous benefits related to batch management of sewage sludge and to analyse the manifold consequences on pattern of storages. A better storage appears to be the main way of progress for the next years in France.	sewage;sewage sludge;sludge
170	Design and performance of constructed wetlands for the treatment of parlour washing effluents. Initially designed for the treatment of domestic wastewater, Vertical Flow Reed Bed Filters (VFRBF) have been adapted for washing parlour effluents to study the feasibility of the treatment of such effluents instead of their storage and land spreading. This work has been done within the framework of the Programme of Control of Pollution of Agricultural Origin (PMPOA). It was necessary to adapt the design of VFRBF to minimise the investment costs. Several experimental sites have been built, monitored and progressively adapted. Following a septic tank of 3 to 9 m3, the best design was considered to be: 2 stages of VFRBF in series each composed of 2 filters which are alternately fed on a weekly rhythm. The total active area is approximately equivalent to 0.25 m2 per dairy cow for the washing effluent of the milking machine and milk-storage tank. It is increased to 0.4 m2 per dairy cow when the washing effluents from the floor and walls of the milking parlour are added to the previous ones. The 1st stage filters takes up 65 % of the total area. Based on a survey done in 3 farms, the concentrations achieved a range of 50 to 180 mgL-1 in COD, 5 to 75 mgL-1 in BOD5, 10 to 60 mgL-1 in SS. The nitrification, which can be considered as a good indicator of the redox potential within the filter media, was not complete but much more effective than in buried intermittent sand filters [ISF] studied for the same purpose but some of them have clogged prematurely, which did not allow to approve this system.	constructed wetlands
171	Tax competition and effectiveness of public service delegation. The paper analyses the consequences of fiscal competition on the efficiency of the delegation of local public services. Efficiency is determined by the expected status of the budget constraint, that is soft (a bailout occurs in financial distress) or hard (no bailout). We first stress that delegation contracts are prone to renegotiation. Then, in a theoretical setting, we show that tax competition in a decentralized economy may be welfare improving as it enhances local authorities' commitment capacity. Firms to which the provision of local public services is delegated do not expect bailout anymore and restructure.	tax

A comparison of the impact of condensations on various plastic films and glass was carried out using the method of isothermal hot boxes ""in situ"". Results show that wet films perform better than dry ones. On the contrary, condensations reduce the performance of glass."	
173	"Conditions and means of computerised data management for the implementation of sustainable agriculture: strategic exploration using the ""audit patrimonial"" method.. French new regulations about integrated farming are supposed to set a new standard for French farmers' agricultural practices, which will have to be recorded as evidence of the respect of the national requirements. However, various actors are already concerned in farmers' agricultural practices: authorities, development organisations, account departments, food-industry actors This organisation of the agricultural world, together with the development of computer science and technology has led to a growing demand of data from the farmers. As a consequence, the farmer cannot structure the agricultural practices data in a stated goal, which is described by the 'audit patrimonial' method as a systemic lack of appropriation (""patrimonialisation"" in the sense of the ""audit patrimonial"" method) of the farmer's data. What is more, the way for different organizations (including farms) to record the information is combined paper and computer medium. All these media communicate unequally between the actors. A lot of private firms, both usual ones in agriculture and emergent ones, offer a new kind of software to farmers and partners. Processing practices data become a stake for all the actors, so does consulting loaning to farmers and their partners. This new market is mainly created by traceability and environmental regulations demands, but also by the opportunities new technologies of information and communication, particularly GPS and geographic equipment. As a result, the relations between actors and their prerogatives are being upset. No software is able to manage all the information specified in the integrated farming base so far, but they all collectively do. The farmer is eager to save data acquisition, hence a growing need for the software to communicate one to another with the help of a standard. Data property issue needs to be raised by the authorities, so does the issue of the statute of data base managers, as data bases are going to centralise agricultural practices data. Are several databases communicating thanks to the Internet a better guarantee of property rights? The statements developed through the article throw a new light on what could be the aim of integrated farming: together with being the first step for the farmer to manage environment, being also the way to simplify data acquisition for farmers."	agriculture;farmers
174	Narrow and wooded dykes reinforcement : the particular situation of Isere river levees. Protection dikes along the Isere river are unusual as they are wooded, narrow and made with loose material. They were built with a design of the kind upstream toe under water. As a result, it is observed both a recurrent risk of face sliding and a typical risk of internal erosion due to root progression within heterogeneous embankments. Moreover, this vegetation induces a real difficulty for human inspection and diagnosis. For those reasons, the local association in charge of dikes maintenance established the following strategy: along normal sections, vegetation reviving with a planting scheme in order to stabilize forest stand; along sections with strengthening necessity, site planning with external toe thickening and delayed intervention within river-bed. This graduated reinforcement design allows for one typical section the time-spreading out of expenses and a satisfactory stake to dike-aging weighing.	river;isere river
175	Evaluating species response to erosive perturbations: implication for the ecological restoration of eroded lands. The aim of this paper is to illustrate how current investigations on species response to erosive perturbations can be of major interest for the ecological restoration of eroded marly lands in the French Southern Alps. Indeed, restoration ecology and ecological engineering are close fields, both stemming from applied ecology, but belonging to two different circles, respectively the researcher's and the practitioner's world. These two disciplines are complementary and present strong interactions. The aim of our investigations is to determine, explain and predict species resistance to uprooting and burial by marly sediment caused by concentrated runoff and shallow mass movements. The use of plant traits to relate species performance to their morphological characteristics offers the possibility to generalize the results and is therefore highly relevant. The results of our study can be integrated in different ways into ecological rehabilitation or restoration actions. They can be used to evaluate the success of restoration projects or the vulnerability of eroded lands, and to optimize management strategies.	ecology;ecological engineering
176	Flooding in the Bourbre basin (Isère). Flood risk management is one of the aspects of the problem of water course management and can affect water resources and the associated ecosystem. The factors at the origin of the risk call for an exhaustive study at basin level. Applied to the Bourbre basin (Isère), the « Inondabilité » method provides an objective knowledge base which allows an appropriate management scheme to be set out. The operational consequences of this study are described as well as the progress that still has to be made to generalise this type of approach. This particular case indicates the importance of having an objective knowledge of the risk to implement the golden rule of Dynamic Braking in water management and to achieve reasonable land use control in flood plains.	water;flooding
177	Consequences of urban pressure on the organisation of landscapes. The case of the Chartreuse Massif. This study analyses the spatial changes observed in a rural mountainous areas (Chartreuse Natural Park) due to urban pressure from two main nearest towns (Grenoble and Chambery). First the land use was observed and compared on aerial photography in the period 1981-2003. This work was made on eight districts of the Chartreuse area distinguishing two level of urban pressure. The results show a marked decrease of agricultural lands when the urban areas and forests (afforestation from land abandonment) clearly increase. The direct link between the urban pressure and the extent of the urban fabric don't appear distinctly. On the other hand, it seems that there is a positive effect of urban pressure on the land abandonment. So the influence of urbanisation and its economic land pressure have negative consequences on agricultural activities. The study show also that the decline of the agricultural lands goes with significant landscape changes such as a decrease of the numbers and the lengths of hedges and a decrease of agricultural clearings in woody lands. Moreover, the changing lands are mainly located in the flattest areas. Finally, the results lead to problems concerning the agricultural activities more and more confined on sloping and low accessible areas.	areas;urban areas;urban;agricultural

Integral part of the management, conservation of rare aquatic plants is urgent in the current context of biodiversity loss. The conservation objectives and practices implemented for the conservation of these rare plants exist at both species and communities (habitat) level. The legislative and regulatory frameworks require such protection, which allows to relaunch inventories and monitoring. But several questions for the future of this conservation are presented, both in terms of methods, but also prospects.	france;rare;rare aquatic
179	In situ conservation of genetic resources of forest trees in metropolitan France. The conservation of forest genetic resources aims at the satisfaction of future needs and the preservation of the adaptability of species in a changing environment. The national policy followed by France in this field since 1991 has enabled the creation of in situ conservation networks for beech (Fagus sylvatica), fir (Abies alba) and sessile oak (Quercus petraea) and ex situ collections for a few other species. Diverse research topics and a broadening of the networks organisation are suggested to improve sampling methods, genetic pollution control, and the management of conservation stands. Such a research effort and a better coordination with the habitat protection networks are needed to improve existing and future networks.	research;environment;france

The public administrative services in charge of food quality have commissioned a working group to establish the certification standards of the French quality label « Label Rouge » for lamb meat, in conformity with the European certification rules. The working group did not have at its disposal any reference experimentations or even a national request coming from the economic actors of the branch. Through a long collective learning it has established a complete set of rules, which have since proved functional.	lamb meat

To help public organisations in charge of aquatic management to achieve objectives of good ecological status of water bodies required by the European Water Framework Directive (WFD), it is essential to model flow in the hydrographical network. Indeed, the classification of water bodies requires the analysis of upstream-downstream relations. In its present state flow cannot be modelled in the DB Carthage® leading us to simplify the initial database.	water;construction
183	Contamination of surface water by pesticides and the role of buffer zones to limit the transfer: State of knowledge and implications for action. Reaching the Water Framework Directive goals towards nonpoint pollution by pesticide implies to combine several complementary actions aiming at reducing both the total applied amounts and their transfer to water bodies. As for that, a sufficient knowledge of local major processes and water pathways is required so as to identify the most adapted actions and the condition of their best efficiency. Buffer strips have been shown to be efficient tools to reduce pesticide transfer into runoff once some elementary practical rules are respected. In particular, they must be settled in position to intercept diffuse runoff and to preserve a good infiltration capacity. In practice, localisation up stream in the catchment is to be promoted.	pesticides;water
184	Contamination of surface water by pesticides and modelling. Before protecting surface water from pollution by using crop treatment products, it is necessary to assess the risks of their transfer, evaluate agricultural scenarios and corrective techniques. The complex transfer mechanisms require mathematical models. Solutions must be found to meet the increasing pressure from regulations. Existing models are imperfect and unsuitable for these aims. Work has been undertaken to improve them and, in the short term, find at least a partial answer to the questions asked. In the longer term, new tools are being developed. This paper defines the nature of the problems to be considered in relation to the scale of the study, outlines these two approaches and describes some examples, which illustrate the complexity of the mechanisms.	water;agricultural;pesticides
185	Water contamination by pesticides: results of a national survey (1998-1999 data). Since 1998, in response to a request from the Minister of Environment, the French Institute for the Environment (IFEN) has carried out annual national surveys on pesticides in water. The three surveys conducted to date showed that pesticides are still being found in French rivers and groundwater in quantities that are often likely to cause environmental disturbance or to exceed authorised thresholds for drinking water production. Each year, the most frequently quantified substances are herbicides (triazines, including breakdown products), whether in surface water or in groundwater. The data is collected from pesticide monitoring network managers (Water Agencies, Regional Offices for the Environment, Departmental Offices for Health and Social Affairs, Regional Offices for Agriculture and Forestry...). The information system implemented to provide these surveys includes a database on water quality in relation to pesticides - SYSIPHE - that allows data to be compiled and processed. At the end of 2000, 700 000 pesticides analysis were collected in this database.	pesticides;environment;water;rivers

187	Contribution of concentrated runoff to the erosion of cultivated sandy soils in the west of the Paris basin: the example of the Dué and Narais watersheds . From 1988 to 1995, we have studied several small watersheds located in the western Paris basin, west to Le Mans, in order to assess the concentrated runoff contribution to erosion on sandy soils. During rainfall periods, it has been possible to observe the formation of rills and gullies, to cartography and measure the features due to erosion, and so to assess the soil losses due to concentrated runoff. Chronic erosion, which produces transfers of deposits from upslope to dry dell bottoms, has been relayed in two occasions (in May 1998 and in May 1990) by catastrophic erosion, which incises the previous sandy accumulations and exports a part of these deposits towards the main rivers. Those coarsed discharges have modified stream dynamics. Preventive actions are suggested.	sandy;runoff
188	Controlling vegetation in forest plantations: first results on micro-environmental changes caused by the use of cover plants. Young tree establishment in forest plantation is often compromised by herbaceous vegetation competition. At present, this vegetation is generally controlled by chemical or mechanical operations but they are criticized either from environmental points of view either for their efficiency. In this prospect, an alternative method consists of sowing cover plants in order to control vegetation. This paper presents first results on the consequences of vegetation cover modification on micro-environmental variables and resources availability in two experiments of planted and seeded trees. Tree development is encouraging but results show that further studies on plants dynamics and seed mixture composition are needed before spreading the technique.	trees

This paper deals with the tools that enable understanding jointly the cost and the effectiveness of best management practices when they are voluntarily adopted by farmers. In such a situation, the diversity of farms, the spatial variety of their practices and the heterogeneity of the watersheds makes it necessary to design a pluridisciplinary approach to highlight a clear ex-ante analysis of the global effect on a territory of heterogeneous individual decisions. We present here such an approach, with an integrated model of a small watershed in Brittany.	adoption;environment
190	Costs of the agricultural use of municipal sewage sludge in the agricultural sector. This study is based on a survey carried out in 1998 on 71 full scale waste water treatment plants in France (ranging from 400 to 650 000 population equivalents; liquid, pasty, dry, limed and composted sludge). The collected information deals with investment and operating costs of the various stages of the sewage sludge disposal procedures: treatment, storage, handling, transport, application, specific cultural practices, studies and management. The results put forward the relative importance of the cost of sludge treatment (55 % of the total cost, in average). Without sludge treatment, the costs directly related to agricultural use (provisions for depreciation included), with storage and operations of controlled land application, amount to: 1,98 tax free Euros/equivalent-inhabitant, 177,7 tax free Euros/t dry matter, 40,5 tax free Euros/t wet sludge and 0.06 tax free Euros/m3 drinking water. Behind these average values, there is however a great variability in the cost of different types of sludge disposal procedures.	agricultural;water;sewage

So far as natural risks are concerned, prevention has to exploit folk memory in order to be effective: the recollection of certain events in Savoie illustrates this requirement. However, in spite of the development of computer technology and means of communication, folk memory of risks is still too often defective and fragmentary and relies on disparate sources of information. Issuing warnings is also a means of informing and alerting mountain users so that they can adapt their behaviour to the constraints imposed by the natural dangers.

After having mentioned several references to books on systematics and indicated some particularities about the phylogeny of macro-algae, the authors are giving a description of some main morphological and biological characteristics of macrophyte algae. Many revues having treated of the different habitats where macro-algae can live, some biotopes are presented here with a more detailed typology for Characeae communities, linked to water type, permanence and vegetation development period. The importance of ecological factors affecting their distribution and their possible use as bioindicators, are also presented.	algae;macro algae
193	From the control of invasive aquatic plants to hydrosystem management. Since several years, a part of the applied research of the Water Quality Research Unit concerns aquatic macrophyte populations of different types of water bodies (rivers, lakes, ponds, wetlands). These organ-isms have the particularity to be primary producers and habitats for other aquatic organisms. It plays multiple roles in the functioning of the ecosystems and constitues frequent management stakes. Always considered in interface with aquatic ecosystem management, this applied research developed itself from leaning on the demands from many managers confronted to variable problems linked to the macrophyte populations of the water bodies that they have to manage (proliferations, regression or disappearance). Methodological clarifications have been performed about geographical distribution, quantification of the populations, interrelations between the plants and abiotic parameters and plant dynamics. Many other exchanges of questions and information with managers, users of the water bodies, specialized societies working on plant management, etc., permitted to propose modes of management of native aquatic plants or some invasive taxa. These propositions of management have been followed in several cases by concrete implementations, what permitted to institute regular relations with the managers. This dialogue, first constructed on aqua-tic plant management, enlarged in most cases to more general aspects as evolutions of the ecosystems under strong anthropic pressures, plants with patrimonial interest, conservation of the biodiversity of the biotopes and habitats, etc., permitting to establish constructive relations with these partners.	water
194	Definition and identification of objects on a high spatial resolution image. Application to the differentiation of chestnut orchard types . High-resolution spatial data are bound to be more and more reachable for all users. Facing so many data, we propose to define pertinent object, both on thematic and methodological levels. The aim is to automate the extraction of objects that are suitable for research and management. This process is used to distinguish classes of chestnut tree orchards and copses with infrared aerial photos of IFN. A chestnut tree classification is elaborated so as to associate shapes with agricultural practices. Not only do objects differ in colour but also in component (chestnut tree crowns) spatial distribution. CLAPAS is selected: the classification integrates points proximity which allows to distinguish classes with the same colour but differing in texture. Reference classes are chosen on the image thanks to vegetation observation (assisted classification). The analysis shows that, in spite of confusions, output fit with sites checking.	agricultural;orchards
195	 Farm livestock slurries - a short review of the situation in Portugal. Many environmental problems associated with the livestock production in Portugal are identified in terms of the load of organic material and nutrients. Their effect has been reflected in the variable quality of ground and surface water and, to some extent, in the soil characteristics. Several approaches to livestock management have been adopted and practised in the last few years as a result of the implementation of both specific and general environmental legislation. However, the existing legislation on pig slurry standards for discharge in water bodies, for example, is unrealistic when compared to the river water quality requirements. Research, which has been undertaken recently on pollution prevention due to livestock farming indicates that the most sustainable option for the majority of Portuguese livestock farms is the application of both slurry and manure onto land. A more detailed assessment on a local/farm basis is needed in order to confirm this potential.	portugal;farm livestock;water
196	Agricultural abandonment and stakeholder strategies in a canton of Haute-Provence. Decision-makers are concerned by the afforestation of pastoral and cultivated areas as a consequence of land abandonment. This process is perceived as a symptom of territorial dysfunction. A methodology is proposed for a small region to place the land abandonment in context in relation to the expectations of local parties, to delimit its real extent and to explain it in terms of farmers' and landowners' strategies. We note that the problem is acute in pastoral areas belonging to active local farmers, but is less serious in cultivated areas. It also seems that the sectors suffering abandonment are used for a wide range of activities and are attractive enough to reinforce a somewhat favourable local perception of the process, although this view ignores the medium term risks incurred.	agricultural abandonment;farmers
197	Irrigators' associations are making reforms based on what they find just and fair. Internal rules revisions and users participation are needed for the sustainability of irrigation collective institutions as shown in the literature. This article reports three institutional reforms carried out by three groups of farmers organized in Water User Association (ASA) in the Lot administrative unit (France). These reforms lead to different modalities of water and cost sharing among neighbouring farmer groups. This diversity is due to the variety of justice and equity concepts mobilized by the involved groups. It does not exist a unique equitable pricing system, a single just water allocation, an impartial control system, but different solutions perceived as just by those who elaborate and live its. This speaks for a large autonomy of communities managing common pool resources in the definition of their internal functioning rules.	water;equitable pricing;irrigation
198	"From research watershed to operational watershed: which is more suited for understanding and controlling diffuse agricultural pollution?. The watersheds have been for a long time an essential tool both for hydrology and research works on diffuse pollution, mainly production from agriculture. Since the first ""representative and experimental"" watersheds (BVRE), devoted to hydrological and hydro-chemical measurements, the concepts improved and the study strategies become more sophisticated. The increasing recourse to ""the watershed approach"" within the framework of operational purposes, constitutes a consequence of this research. This article aims at establishing an assessment of the knowledge on the watershed approach, applied to the problem of agricultural diffuse pollution. After a brief history of the concept of watershed and its contribution to the works on diffuse pollution, the main methodological assets and their operational adaptations are presented, within the framework of the actions implemented to control pollution. Specifications of the operational devices as well as some elements concerning the choice of their setting up, are also dealt with."	research;watershed;agricultural

200	From AEM to CTE: a difficult transition - Analysis of an actual case in the Upper Valley of Allier (France). In order to limit the agricultural decline, in the frame of the agri-environmental measures (AEM), a local operation had been set up in 1995 in the Upper Valley of Allier in Haute Loire (France). Coming from a local initiative its setting had gathered a large number of actors and the quality of its implementation had reached to a high level of contractualisation. This situation, a priori favourable to the emergence of a collective project for the CTE (contrats territoriaux d'exploitation or land use contracts) however has not missed the difficulties of implementation of the procedure. The original mechanisms of these cumbersomeness are analyzed here basing on a comparison between the two approaches.	agricultural;france
201	Neurones in champagne . Acidity is an important factor in Champagne wine quality. Predicting acidity levels is therefore an indispensable requirement when determining, which wine production process to use once the must has been supplied. Various tests which have been undertaken show that those models based on neural network programming are more accurate than either linear or quadratic function models, although they still prove to be less accurate than the more conventional analytical methods. The model generated using laboratory data from small-scale wine-making processes, has been successfully tested on data from industrial-scale processes, indicating the model's robustness. This decision-making tool could in future be used by wine-makers to optimise blending and thus improve the quality of the Champagne region's wines.	wine;champagne wine;champagne

203	Description of hydrological regimes in high waters: new formulation for flood-duration-frequency analysis and engineering applications. This paper presents a Flood Frequency Analysis (FFA), which takes into account the notion of duration: the flood-duration-frequency (QdF) method. QdF analysis is similar to the intensity-duration-frequency analysis commonly used for rainfall. This article describes the general framework of the QdF approach and the theoretical aspects with detailed steps of calculation. Two applications are then presented. The first application concerns the derivation of Synthetic Mono-Frequency Hydrographs (SMFH) from the QdF fitted curves. The main advantage of this approach is that all the characteristics of the SMFHs are related to the same return period. The second application illustrates the potential for describing the impact of a presumed climate change, by analyzing simulated discharges under climatic scenarios. Results are compared to the present regime using two descriptors derived from the QdF analysis: an indicator of the flood dynamic behaviour and the 10-year-return period instantaneous peak flood.	flood;climate change
204	Sludge dewatering in sludge drying reed beds (SDRBs) . Sludge dewatering in reed beds has been recently used in France. For activated sludge in extended aeration the design of such reed beds is based on a surface loading of 50 kg DM m-2 y-1, in France and Denmark as well when the growth of the reeds is well established. In Denmark, this type of dewatering process is used for much more larger cities than the ones in France. In each plant recently built in Denmark, the design is different and the number of beds is greater, at least eight. This distinctive feature seems to be of major interest to increase the dry matter content of the dewatered sludge and also to make easier the scheduled withdrawals of the beds separately.	sludge;france

206	Determination of priority zones of forest intervention and design of « green » zones within risk mitigation plans. An example of researcher-field transfer in France. The methodology of forest classification according to their role of protection against natural hazards, development by the Cemagref, is parameterized and operational for the north-alpine forest stands. This methodology is adaptable to other mountain range if you adapt classification sheets used in north-alpine methodology to the new geographic conditions. The main goals of this study were to transfer of knowledge and competence to management forest services.	alpine;north alpine;france
207	Two case studies of floods caused by overland flow: what lessons can be learned for better prevention?. Floods are generally due to the vicinity of a river. Nevertheless, strong rainfall events and the subsequent surface runoff may submerge parts of land away from any watercourse. The results may reach the same disastrous level, and their prevention constitutes a major concern. However, little knowledge is available today on such floods, so great being the events' diversity and unpredictability. By mean of two case studies, this paper brings out some useful elements for the analysis of such processes, the accounting for them in land settlement, as well as questions which should be addressed by future research programs.	floods
208	Sustainable development of mountain resorts: inventory and prospect. For a long time the development of winter sports resorts has been concerned with the question of environmental protection. With the advent of the concept of sustainable development and the uncertainties of the climate change, the initiatives claiming their will to perpetuate the local savings by the sustainable tourism multiply. The authors suggest us revising the main questions of research relative to the durability of winter sports resorts. They demonstrate the importance of the social and economic dimensions in the implementation for concrete actions to facilitate a sustainable development of the mountain territories.	mountain resorts;climate change
209	Diagnosis of pesticide nonpoint pollution and management practices to reduce transfer to water. Despite a strict procedure as regards pesticide registration and a cautious respect of application recommendation, pesticide may reach aquatic resources, mainly, due to the complex processes responsible for their transformation and transfer in natural systems (as climate, soil and under-ground properties, landscape organisation, agricultural practices). As for that, it is necessary to promote, in addition, relevant practices adapted to local conditions so as to reduce the potential of pesticide to move, both at the field and the catchment scales. But, as the involved parameters are numerous it is essential to achieve, first, a detailed diagnosis of the main causes which may lead to pesticide transfer on a defined area and then to identify corresponding pertinent actions. This article first explains the main agricultural and management practices which may reduce pesticide transfer to water resources and then proposes a methodology to achieve a diagnosis at the three scales of the large area (region), the catchment and the farm so as to enhance pertinent actions at each level.	pesticide;water

211	Diagnosis and analysis of risks linked to the ageing of dams - Development of methods to assist expertise. Diagnosis and risk analysis are essential to insure safety of dams in operation. In this field, powerful methods have been produced and provide useful aids in modelling, simulation, statistical analysis, reliability, etc. However it is necessary to use the expert's judgement judgment when the works are complex and unique, when data is imprecise or insufficient, and when a preliminary diagnosis or detailed analysis is being made. Using their experience and knowledge, experts are able to provide answers and recommendations to a specific problem. The authors propose methods to support expert diagnosis and risk analysis. The main goal is to capitalise on the expert's knowledge and feedback and to build up database of dam pathologies and database of ageing case histories. This work uses reliability techniques and qualitative reasoning models. In terms of practical applications, the research produced a knowledge database on dam pathologies, and an ageing history database was compiled from dams having experienced deterioration. Computer aids to assist experts in the diagnostic and risk analysis tasks are under development.

213	Danish guidelines for small-scale constructed wetland systems for onsite treatment of domestic sewage. The Danish Ministry of Environment and Energy has passed a new legislation that require the wastewater from single houses and dwellings in rural areas to be treated adequately before discharge into the aquatic environment. Therefore official guidelines for a number of onsite treatment solutions have been produced. These include guidelines for soakaways, biological sand filters, technical systems as well as different types of constructed wetland systems. This paper summarises briefly the guidelines for horizontal flow constructed wetlands, vertical flow constructed wetlands, and willow systems with no outflow and with soil infiltration. There is still a lack of compact onsite solution that will fulfil the treatment classes demanding 90% removal of phosphorus. Therefore work is presently being carried out to identify simpler and robust P-removal solutions.

215	Diversity of rural areas and the place of agriculture. Rural areas are not any longer considered, as they have been in France, as productive agricultural areas. The links between agriculture and rural areas area are changing. According to a socio-economic analysis, this chapter aims to analyze rural dynamics and agriculture contribution to rural attractiveness. Upon existing studies, but also research on rural areas under urban pressure, two dimensions of rural dynamics area underlined. The first one is the relation between town and countryside; the second one is the spatial reorganisation (polarisation processes and territorial construction).	rural areas;agricultural areas;agriculture
216	"Documentation and traceability on farms: towards quality document management. Regulation and commercial requirements are more and more important in the traceability of products and practices. This context alters considerably the way information and documents are managed in farm enterprises. With the increasing number of documents to manage, farmers meet nowadays difficulties in their documentary management. We propose in this article to identify the main documents required in the different vegetal and animal production chains. We then present the methodology and the main results of the Project "" Analysis of tools and data to provide traceability in farm enterprise "" and particularly the established manual. We discuss finally the interest of such an inventory to promote a quality documentary management and help farmers to respect regulations and contracts."	documentary;managed;production
217	Drainage and waterproofing on capping of the landfill of Saint Brès. Objectives of the Saint-Brès landfill capping are waterproofing, water drainage and earth retaining. Slopes on cover reach 66% with length superior to 10 m. Geosynthetic solution is composed from bottom to top of a protective geotextile, a drainage geocomposite industrially associated to a textured 8/10 mm polyethylene film to increase the stability of the system and a earth retaining geogrid. Geocomposite has been designed with Lymphéa® software to drain a rain of 266 mm/day. A polyethylene film was welded on site to increase the waterproofing of the capping.	water;landfill
218	About a research path and a few detours.... This article traces the history of an interdisciplinary research between a nivologist and a sociologist. The researchers were concerned at the beginning, by the issue of relations between the experts and the political decision makers, in situation of crisis or natural risk. However, they were diverted by other issues linked to the relationship between exact sciences and social sciences, so called « soft ». Briefly, these issues aimed at explaining the nature of scientific and technical expertise in the field of the natural hazard prevention in alpine environment. Issues are also about the objects of researchers and experts, called « social constructs » by the more fashionable social sciences. Finally, the researchers dealt with the issue of language and relations between experts and public, the so called « non advised ».	research
219	Dynamics of land redistribution among farmers in small areas. At regional level, farms are disappearing and releasing land, production quotas (milk quotas) and subsidies (dairy farm subsidies, sheep farm subsidies, etc.), most of which are being taken over by remaining farms. What are the factors associated with the farms and their socio-economic environment, which are causing the farms to disappear and release production facilities? How are these production facilities redistributed among the remaining farms? Who benefits? What are the consequences for land occupation? The answers to these questions can define an approach and decision making tools for the government or local authorities who, at local and departmental levels, are involved in the redistribution of the land and the restructuring of farms.	land occupation
220	Dynamics of natural afforestation in Provence. The French Mediterranean region, particularly marked by large-scale abandoning of agricultural land since the beginning of the 20th century, is particularly suitable for studying the dynamics of natural reforestation after cultivation has ceased. The models include various pre-forest and forest formations with an expansionist demographic strategy, representing the most remarkable situations as far as growth is concerned. Among these models, three categories can be distinguished: i) expansionist with fast colonisation, ii) expansionist with fast and long-term colonisation, iii) expansionist with a zoochoric determinism. These three models appear successively after cultivation and/or after fire, through their accompanying flora are differentiated according to geographical zones from Basse Provence up to the Mediterranean Alps. All three models feature the production of a high biovolume and abundant representation in space, whether the vegetation consists of bushes or forest species. For milieus with high constraints because of recurrent disturbances, the ligneous population adopts resistance models. These are differentiated from the expansionist models by a much longer generation time with narrower spreading (variable from year to year), high rate of renewal (high aptitude for pruning and development of axillary systems), and low inter-species competition (by wide occupation of space by a few dominant individuals). In the case of neglected forests or long-abandoned cultivation without disturbance, the growth of the vegetation can be covered by a stabilising model, which in the Mediterranean region results in the installation and development of permanent pubescent oak forests. Finally, beyond the phytoecological analysis of the dynamics of forest populations, the statistics of agricultural and forest areas as well as the study of the main social changes help to illustrate and fine-line the interpretation of the models presented, particularly through spectacular progression of expansionist conifers and deciduous oaks over the last century as well as deep-going transformations in the methods of using the soil.	agricultural;population;cultivation
221	Automatic sampling and measurement of grain quality during harvesting. The new possibilities given by the sensors integration on harvest equipment open the way of real time site-specific quality measurement. How to validate the measurement done by this way? To answer this question, we have developed a georeferenced sampling system. The laboratory analyses of these samples allow to create reference site-specific maps usable to control real time measurement. A first use was about site-specific proteins level measurement.	
222	Restoration ecology and ecological engineering. Issues, focal points and uses. Territories face more and more the consequences on the environment of the human activities (agriculture, forestry and industry) and are forced to restore the damaged areas. The involvement of the professional men and women to the collaborative production of scientific results with researchers forms the singularity and relevance of this scientific area. It answers to necessary demand to understand scientific and technical mechanisms of ecosystems, and to develop adapted solutions. This special issue illustrates the variety of actions of research lead in this theme. It also focuses on the specific case of abraded lands and the use of the ecological engineering to rehabilitate them.	ecological engineering;ecology;researchers;environment
223	Wood economy and forest management: a favoured approach but still to be developed. Recent changes in forest management lead to question the predominance of wood production, in favour of other forest functions. This evolution is legitimate; nevertheless, wood production is and will remain an important factor in forest management decisions and in sylvicultural techniques, which justifies a better use of economical approaches in forest management planning. The paper stresses first that the administrative region, or a group of regions, is a relevant scale for an economical analysis. It then reviews different topics about long term, prices and production costs, in order to show how economical reasoning can adapt to the specificities of forest economy and it can give an unexpected statement about the conditions of wood production. Finally, the paper recommends to develop the use of economical methods and tools in forest management planning and sylvicultural management.	wood;wood economy;economy;wood production;evolution
224	"Ecotechnologies and eco-design: concepts and implementation. The ecotechnologies (or ecologically rational technologies) have less impact on the environment, use in a more sustainable way the resources and authorize the recycling of whole or part of their waste in a more acceptable way than the technologies they replace. The methodological problems raised by those are both upstream; it is the eco-design; and downstream, when concerning the definition of impact assessment criteria; it is the eco-assessment. This article focuses on eco-design techniques with a prior synthesis of various design methodologies, which contributed to its genesis. Principles, as well as the methods at the disposal of the designers, are reviewed. The approach is illustrated with a research project example about energy wood harvesting. During this project were implemented various methods within the concept framework of ""integrated assessment"" and analysis of ""technological scenarios""."	environment;eco design;research
225	"Ecotoxicological and toxicological aspects of pesticides - From regulatory risk assessment to environmental monitoring. Risk assessment is needed for registration of each new plant protection product at EU level. In France, the competent authority for registration is the Ministry of Agriculture, taking into account opinions from ""Commission des toxiques"" and ""Comité d'homologation"". In regulatory risk assessment, environmental risk is estimated by the usual approach, combining exposure and hazard to calculate risk. Exposure is characterized by estimation of Predicted Environmental Concentrations (PEC). Hazard is estimated from ecotoxicological assays with different plant and/or animal species. Risk is characterized as a toxicity/exposure ratio, which is compared to a trigger value. This approach is simple, probably efficient, and could be scientifically improved. However, the system is not perfect, the main limitation being the variety of local environmental conditions. Furthermore, authorizations are based on specific products, and cannot integrate a variety of agricultural practices. Biomonitoring is needed."	pesticides;france;ecotoxicological
226	Effect of feed protein content on ammonia volatilisation of pig effluents in the barn, during storage and spreading. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of three strategies of protein feeding (12, 16 and 20%) on animal performance, nitrogen excretion and ammonia emission in the laboratory and in the field. The animals (15 castrated males) were housed individually in metabolism cages and were fed one of the three diets. The experiment lasted 21 days and urine and faeces were collected separately. Samples of each type of effluent (urine alone, fresh slurry and 18-day old slurry) were placed in a laboratory system designed to measure ammonia emission for 7 days. In the field, measurements of ammonia volatilisation were made during storage and surface-application of slurry. Lowering dietary crude protein while maintaining normal growth rate reduced urinary nitrogen and total amount of effluent, because of a lower water consumption. Ammoniacal nitrogen content, total nitrogen content and pH decreased when dietary crude protein decreased. This consequently reduced ammonia emission during all the stages of the management of the effluents. Over the whole process of the slurry ammonia emission was reduced by 63% when dietary protein decreased from 20 to 12%.	protein;feed protein;animal;dietary protein;pig
227	Energy efficiency and diversity of agricultural production systems: case studies of farms in Burgundy. The energy efficiency of a farm is the ratio of energy produced to the sum of all the direct and indirect energy used. Eleven farming systems which are representative of agricultural production in Burgundy (vineyards excluded) are analyzed:–two arable farms, with efficiency above 5;–three mixed farms (arable/livestock), with efficiency between 1 and 5;–six livestock farms with efficiency lower than 1.In livestock farming, feeding comes top or second of the list of energy consumers. In other farms, direct energy comes first, followed by fertilizers for arable farms. Cross exchange of organic feed and manure between arable and livestock farms in the same local region could be the answer to achieving sustainable local agriculture and a better use of local agricultural resources.	agricultural;efficiency;energy efficiency
228	Elaboration of a decision support tool to limit nitrate losses. The example of the main soils and cropping systems of Val de Saône. A decision support tool was elaborated to evaluate nitrate losses to groundwater for the main soils and cropping systems of Val de Saône (France). The approach consisted to simulate several scenarios of management of cropping systems crossed with the soil types. The results confirmed the protecting role of permanent grassland regarding the nitric pollution of groundwater. They gave evidence of the predominant effect of soil texture on nitrate losses from cultivated lands, much greater for sandy soils than for clayey, clayey sandy or loamy soils. The effect of various cropping practices (i.e. fertilisation, irrigation, introduction of soybean, establishment of catch crops) was also discussed as well as the impact of unfavourable climatic conditions, like a dry year reducing yields or a wet year generating compaction in clayey soils.	
229	Development of an information system with spatial references to assist management of Atlantic costline wethlands. Atlantic marshlands (250,000 ha) are areas where diverse private interests are expressed. New occupants, such as hunters, join landowners and farmers. These areas also have a collective stake in relation to the various functions occupying these natural areas. In these environments subject to the hazards of nature, man's actions, and complex physical operations where land and water are closely linked, increasingly specialised uses make it increasingly difficult to established reasoned, joint management. By federating research in several fields, we have attempted to propose methods and provide knowledge to favour the establishment of information systems. These systems favour shared knowledge to facilitate negotiations between users and managers, associating them by means of communication tools founded on spatial representation, for example. We have developed a dual approach to accomplish this: technical research on establishment procedures for these types of systems, and a series of thematic research concerning the content of the relative knowledge bases. We have distinguished three representation scales corresponding simultaneously to marshland operational modes and intervention contexts for managers and users: local (individual, patch/ditch), intermediate (syndicate/association/community, management parameter/lot) and regional (catchment area/ local authorities/ agencies/ SAGE). Many theme groups were studied: structure and physical condition of ditches networks, hydrological operation in wet environments, water and aquatic habitat quality, aquatic plant and fish communities. Special attention has been given to salt marshland users and their impact on aquatic environment evolution and operation. While the demand was not validated at the different chosen scales, actions have been taken to establish tools for local management of these wetlands, and to introduce information structuring concerning the state of these marshlands (operating report) on a regional scale.	atlantic marshlands;atlantic costline;managers
230	"Elaboration of a typological method for agricultural drainage ditches and their potential behaviour with regard to pesticides.  In order to reduce non-point source pollution in small rural watersheds, various actions have to be encouraged, from developing ""good practices"" at the field scale to the identification of ""buffer zones"" in the watershed. In the particular case of partially land-drained watersheds, the hydrographic network is most of the time quite dense and should play a great role in limiting the transfer of pollutants collected at the field scale (""in-stream processes""). The aim of this paper is to present a method to characterize the potential buffer role of ditches. This method is based on a typological approach and had been applied to a small rural subsurface-drained catchment in Western France (brook of Cétrais, Loire- Atlantique). The results obtained in this particular watershed show that the actual hydrographic network has a limited potential role in reducing pollution by pesticides."	pesticides;typological;agricultural;watershed;france
231	Technical and economic comparisons of wastewater treatment systems adapted to small communities. It's possible now to count 11 types of wastewater treatment plants adapted to small communities. Elements of choice are listing in five following classes: The quality and quantity of wastewater; The receiving body; the natural constraints of the location; the economical aspects (investment and maintenance); the subjective constraints (visual, olfactive, ...) Each wastewater treatment plant has advantages and disadvantages. In a specific context, the choice of the most appropriate technique is possible. This article contributes to help such thoughtful method.

233	Removal of phosphorus via water weed cutting of emergent vegetation in constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment. The amount of phosphorus, which could be removed from wastewater via harvesting is given by phosphorus standing stocks and the harvesting schedule. Available data from 28 constructed wetlands around the world indicate standing stock in the range of 0.4 to 10.5 g P m-2, 0.6 - 9.8 g P m-2 and 0.2 to 6.5 g P m-2 for Phalaris arundinacea, Phragmites australis and Typha spp., i.e. the most commonly used plants in constructed wetlands. The inflow loading values vary widely among systems; for the systems designed for the secondary treatment of sewage inflow P loadings usually range between 100 and 200 g P m-2 yr-1 but values up to 800 g P m-2 yr-1 have been reported. These figures clearly indicate that the amount of P removed via harvesting is usually low. However, for tertiary treatment systems with inflow < 20 g P m-2 yr-1 this removal route could be significant.	wetlands;water;phosphorus
234	Ammonia emission after slurry spreading: the problem. The more suitable techniques for the measurements of losses are briefly reviewed. In particular two important approaches are described: firstly, those based on enclosure methods and, secondly, a range of methods based on micrometeorological techniques. Whilst it is not the objective of the present paper to discuss in detail the quantification of NH3 fluxes and sources, some recent figures from literature data are also mentioned.	
235	Ammonia emission after slurry spreading: quantification and control. This paper describes a study carried out in Brittany (Western France) of ammonia losses from surface-applied animal slurries and a laboratory study of the ways of reducing these losses. The experiments were conducted on grass, stubble and arable land using wind tunnels to calculate the total ammoniacal nitrogen (TAN) lost from an experimental plot (1m2). The tests carried out in four departments in Brittany in 1993 revealed that the ammonia losses (NH3) varied between 5% and 63% of the total ammoniacal nitrogen (NH4+) applied in the slurry. On average, 72% of the losses occurred within the first 12 hours after spreading. Significant correlation was found between the ammonia losses (as a percentage of TAN applied) and mean air temperature and the nitrogen rate applied (kg of N-NH4+ per ha). Laboratory tests in a measurement cell revealed that prior acidification of the slurry and the addition of calcium chloride (CaCl2, 2H2O) gave an 85% reduction in the ammonia lost.	
236	"Landscaping, ecological and economic considerations related to the development of spontaneous afforestation. Example of wooded grazing lands in the regional nature park in the ""Haut-Jura. The territory of the Haut-Jura Park is located in a medium mountain area. It is covered to 70% by the forest and is marked by the presence of extensive agriculture mainly related to the production of the special Haut-Jura cheese brands having an ""Origin Verified Designation"". The tendency of farmers to concentrate on their lands, which are most easily cultivated has led to insufficient use of areas which were historically used for forestry and grazing grounds. This has led to spontaneous reforestation of the abandoned grazing grounds. After a description and a historical analysis of the operation of these wooded pastures and the specific local traditions, the study of the changes and practice leads to the ecological, landscaping and economic consequences of these reforested areas. Finally, to reconcile these collective considerations with the status of private property of most of these spaces, often vast, various types of operations are proposed with a multiple-use approach: agriculture, forestry, value of the land and tourism. The goal is to allow these landscapes to find a permanent place in the economy of the region, its quality of life and its traditional products."	agriculture;landscaping
237	Phosphorus enrichment of the soils in a watershed. By analysing total phosphorus along 15 soils cross-section in 5 parcels of an experimental water basin in Brittany, we obtained two verifications. The first one confirms, that total phosphorus retention in surface increase more than at 60 centimeters deeper. Buffering capacity in the 20 first centimeters of cultivated soil move from 1000 up to 2500 mg of total phosphorus per kg of soil: we observed that phosphorus adsorption can't easily reach 60 deep. A small part of it, especially polyphosphates correlated with aluminium and iron oxides, is supposed to move down. However we measured small quantities of phosphorus at 40 and 60 cm, that shows leaching exists, but in low contribution. The second and most important point is about the runoff. Different notes show us that the parcel slope has an effect on phosphorus accumulation in water during rainfalls. Particles of soil, move across the slope on short intervals. We observed these resettlements for 9 cross-sections nearby the Coët-Dan stream.	phosphorus;water;total phosphorus
238	Lessons from economic theory to respond to the challenge of the derogation to the Water Framework Directive. The Water Framework Directive (WFD) represents a major change in the European environmental policy as it presents a united and consistent legal framework whose main aim is to prevent and reduce water pollution in Europe, which is considered as excessive. In order to reduce the water pollution, the WFD is setting a binding ambient standard: the « good status » requirement. It will be possible for member states to obtain an exemption by showing that pollution control costs are excessive compared to environmental benefits on the basis of a cost-benefit analysis. Thus, an economic literature review is required for guiding the choice of the valuation methods.	water;economic theory
239	"Between banalization and extinction, what future for the ""pays""? Some foresight elements. During the last decades, the reform of French local government came through decentralization and institutional cooperation. One of the institutional devices of this reform has been the creation of ""pays"", a loose territorial cooperation frame in which several municipalities had to discuss common objectives and to define implementation plans. Based on a forecasting studies methodology, the paper proposes to examine the potential evolution of this institutional level. We examine the main factors shaping the evolution of French local institutions and suggest and discuss five scenarios for the future of the ""pays"", reflecting the respective weight of different authorities and the general dynamics of local government."	evolution;extinction
240	"Land upkeep associated to livestock farming: characteristics and relations to the farms dynamics: study in a valley of the French Massif Central mountains. In areas subject to agricultural decline, the control of fallows and preservation of land upkeep are often a ""by-product"" of farming wanted by managers in charge of the rural development. This ""by-product"" is rarely paid. Our study proposes references and a method to analyse elaboration of this environmental service. It aims to help managers of rural areas with the definition of theirs interventions. Our analyse of farm land-uses and users in a valley of the French Massif Central mountains shows that the capacity of land-upkeep by farming varies in space and time, and with respect to the type of farmers, of their dynamic and their localisation. To analyse and to have an effect on this process, we conclude: 1-the dynamics of jointed farms and their space dispatching have to be studied, 2-interventions should be adapted with respect to type of farmer."	agricultural;rural areas;livestock farming
241	Maintenance of the banks of small streams in the South Channel bocage: responses of herbaceous vegetation to ecological and agricultural processes. Within an Observatory of Research in Environment on the catchment area of the Oir river, in south-Manche, a research project applied to the maintenance of salmon's rivers in an agricultural context (installation of fences and feeding troughs to limit the access of the cattle to the brook), is studying the importance of parameters, which structure the riparian vegetation. A small brook of watershed's head is used in preliminary study. We processed the various information, and then we used a method of multivariate analysis to treat on a hierarchical basis the factors, which determine the composition of the riparian vegetation. The principal factors that differentiate the riparian vegetation seem to be related to the recent anthropic impacts (pasture, with the trampling of banks by animals) and old ones (bocage structure: woodlands and hedges). The secondary factors are related to aspects of hydromorphology and the longitudinal gradient, which would be extended to other small brooks of this type. After a long time, these installations will strongly contribute to create a connectivity of the woody elements on the brook that did not exist (from 21 % of disconnected hedges, one passes to 3 %), but that will require a regular maintenance of the riparian vegetation. Agriculture impact and bocage connection are determinant for herbaceous vegetation composition, parameters unusually considered in riparian management, where focus are done on the hydraulic functioning.	research;environment;maintenance;agricultural
242	Spreading of urban sludge, industrial waste and livestock effluents on agricultural land - Comparison of regulations in October 2000. The objective of this document is first to make a comparison of regulatory texts relating to muck-spreading on agricultural land. The process is based on the European directive 91/676/CEE, which is interested in the whole of the fertilizing contributions containing nitrogen on each agricultural parcel but also on the regulatory texts relating to the classified installations like those relating to water. The nature of the products spread is waste resulting from local districts and industry as well as the effluents of breeding. These matters are spread only because they contain nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Lastly, the principal initiatives in progress to produce and make circulate information muck-spreading are presented. This work fits into a research topic on information systems to aid decision-making, as applied to clean and integrated farming.	urban sludge
243	Agricultural use of sewage sludge: impact on crop productivity and MTE transfer. The Auvergne is an agricultural region with twenty six thousand square kilometres and one million five thousand hectares of useable farm area. There are two farming systems, which need organic products to manage the organic matter status of soils: - the crops in the plain of Limagnes - and the animal farming in the mountains region. In the context of the spreading refusal or the demand of departure for the law, the objectives of the project are to determine the impact of sludge spreading in real crop conditions on productivity and metallic trace element (MTE) contents. Our works confirm the interest of sludge use on agricultural soils in increasing the final dry matter production and playing on different stages of yield since of the first year of spreading. At this stage, they don't reveal direct risk of MTE plant contamination by the sludge spreading according to the regulation conditions. The variability of results relating to the impact of the sludge on the productivity and on the MTE soil/plant transfer from year to year and from site to site has led to constitute a data base of MTE with a threshold contents by species. In the future, the database must be extended to more annual crops. The final objective is to plan the cultural practices and particularly the organic matter management in respect of quality and environmental plant production.	agricultural;sewage;contents

Ecological engineering projects affect spaces belonging to territories on which environmental and social questions are addressed. Those questions have to be taken in account in the design of projects at the local scale. Territorial charters or management plans are documents displaying territorial sustainable development strategies. In this work one examines the possibility to use those documents in order to identify the territorial scale specifications with which the ecosystems and landscape design has to comply. Documents describing five territorial strategies in the French South Alps have been studied. We found that territorial sustainable development charts built on an environment centred prospect are a relevant information resource for defining the global characteristic and functionalities of the sustainable ecosystems, which have to be designed.	ecological engineering;environment
245	Erosion and landscape in Mediterranean mountains: Some lessons learned from a spatial and bibliographic comparison between Southern France and Spanish Catalonia. A comparative study France-Spain of the relationships between erosion, landscape and sustainable development is relied on measurements and regionalization of erosion and inquiries of local stakeholders. In Catalonia (wooded matrix), the paths produce sediments, in Southern Alps (mosaic landscape pattern), it is the case of the badlands. These measurements are confirmed by the first results of a generalization study, with a special methodology. Local stakeholders do not take enough in consideration erosion problem; they are more concerned by fire hazard (Catalonia) and shrub encroachment (French Alps).	erosion;france;catalonia;france spain
246	Forecasting the fate of nutrients derived from organic wastes applied on soils. Wastes organic compounds as manure, slurries, sewage sludge, composts and mixture of such biosolids reach the soils of farmer fields. Sometimes, due to unintentional applications, sewage sludge receives undesirable chemical elements or compounds, some of them being toxic for living organisms. The main question concerns the effects of the various elements of these biosolid. It is of first interest to develop experimental tools able to characterize and quantify the bioavailability of the various components for crops, mainly edible parts of the crops. One of the most efficient methods is utilizing tracer isotopes of each element. As a matter of fact, when a crop takes up a nutrient from to nutritive sources, the soil and the wastes, isotopic labeling of the two sources allows determining, in the crop, the origin of the nutrients. Experiments have been, along time, with 15N, 32P, 40K, 45Ca, 65Zn, 109Cd, 63Ni and finally a lot of isotopic tracers. This method was greatly applied for phosphorus and nitrogen. Phosphorus bioavailability of manure and slurries is near that of water-soluble inorganic P fertilizer as triple super phosphate (TSP) or diammonium phosphate (18-46). Bioavailability of P in sewage sludge depends on the chemical processes applied to the sludge and water. More water is clean, less available is the phosphorus of the wastes. An example, concerning Zn, shows that of nutrients derived from organic wastes depends on a lot of interactions taking place between the residues applied to soils and the soils components.	
247	Estimate of the leaching of atrazine and DEA transported in runoff effluents under a vegetative filter strip and a maize crop installed down-slope. Vegetative filter strip (VFS) can efficiently remove pollutants from surface water runoff by infiltration but the questions remain concerning the following leaching of trapped pesticides. The objective of this study was to evaluate the leaching of atrazine and desethylatrazine (DEA) transported in runoff effluents and trapped by a VFS and to compare the results with the losses under a maize crop installed down-slope. The soil solution was sampled using porous cups installed at 120 cm depth at the edge of a VFS established downhill from a maize plot and in the maize plot. Drainage volumes were calculated by a generic crop model. The results show that losses of pesticides by leaching were approximately the same under VFS and maize plot. Leaching occurred mainly outside the growth season. Calculated leaching amounts of DEA were twice those of atrazine. Annual losses of atrazine plus DEA represent 0.5 % of the amounts applied on the maize.	pesticides;atrazine
248	Geomembranes for waste water treatment marshes and road pollution containment ponds: practical rules resulting from the experience. The use of geomembranes is largely spread for waterproofing of wastewater treatment marshes and road pollution containment reservoirs. The geomembranes indeed make it possible to solve in an economic way the problems of realization of these ponds. The paper presents some recent and characteristic examples. However, to ensure the success of these operations, essential rules must be respected, concerning the choice of the site until, during the construction and its control. The paper reviews the essential rules, which concern all the peoples involved in the project, Owners Building, Project superintendents and contractors.	water
249	"The present situation of the Natura 2000 procedure in France and analysis of the importance of management by agriculture and forestry. The Natura 2000 network must preserve the biological diversity of habitats and species in the European Union, taking into account the economic, social, cultural and regional characteristics of the territories. France has chosen a particular way to apply the ""Habitats"" Directive: the ""document of objectives"" or ""docob"". It defines, through local consultation, the issues at stake, the management objectives, the actions and the appropriate specifications. This study establishes the state of Natura 2000 in France based on data obtained in 2004 on 192 sites through a survey of 118 operators. We present the French sites in terms of, e.g., size, number of municipalities, members of the steering committee and agricultural context. We then analyse the relations between Natura 2000 and agricultural and forestry management. We highlight the positive aspects of Natura 2000 as seen by local stakeholders. The first result of this study is the observation, in May 2004, of the absence of a centralisation of information on the contact details of operators and Natura 2000 sites whose ""documents of objectives"" are currently being drawn up. The main results show the importance of land abandonment, the isolation of small sites in a context of risks linked to certain agricultural practices and the importance of forestry exploitation as 20% of the sites are mainly forested. The results also highlight possible conflicts between leisure and tourism activities, the environmental management as well as agricultural and forestry activities. Despite errors or shortcomings in communication when Natura 2000 was set up, consultation and contractualisation show their value and Natura 2000 is perceived as being favourable both to the preservation of biodiversity and to land development. However, the future of the Natura 2000 network in France depends on the State fully taking into account what is at stake and providing financial resources that meet the expectations generated.

250	Situation of the navigation canal dykes in France. The paper describes the situation of the old dykes network of French waterways, which is made of heterogeneous dykes with some sections in bad state. It describes the different types of dykes, as well as the problems of operators: leakages, dyke breaks, and practices about survey and repairing: sheet piles, clay protections, geomenbranes. The organization of a new management policy by VNF is described.	navigation;france
251	Condition, after 20 years, of a geotextile used for the stabilisation of a spoil heap. The measurements of the tensile strength, break strain and transmissivity presented were made on a sample of a geotextile used in the making of dikes at the foot of a spoil heap. The values obtained, compared to those measured on a control sample found on the site, evidence that the exhumed geotextile, after 20 years in an environment with highly acidic flows, has not suffered from any noticeable deterioration and that it is still capable of serving its purpose in reinforcement and drainage.	
252	"Compared modelling of the upstream Stang Alar catchment. Anjou Recherche, with the FLUPOL model and IHS, with the MOSQITO model, developed by Wallingford Software, have been asked by ""Communauté Urbaine de Brest"" to conduct a modelling study of the Stangalard catchment in Brest. The aim was also to compare these two programs of storm sewer pollution modelling. For Hydraulic, the results show a good comparison between observed and predicted results. If pollution results do not have the same accuracy, the mass balance comparisons are fairly good for the pollutants simulated. On the BREST site, the FLUPOL model seems to give better pollution results while MOSQITO tends to underestimate the pollution load. But the profit is also methodological as interactivity of the different study stages: model building, flow surveying , sampling and verification was found to be useful."	model
253	Study of the flux of water and nitric nitrogen under roots on two catchment areas in the Val de Saône: experimentation with porous cups and modelling with AgriFlux. Experiments were conducted on two catchment areas located in a flood plain in order to determine the nitrate concentrations under roots. A network of 15 agricultural sites representative of the diversity of soils and cropping systems was equipped with porous cups. This article aimed to give the main results obtained halfway through the study. The installation of the porous cups generated disturbances during the first monitoring period. The use of the AgriFlux model gave satisfactory results: simulated concentrations were similar to the measured values. The main factor determining the nitrate fluxes was the soil type: soil texture was a good criterion on which to assume the risks, which were more important in sandy than in clayey or loamy soils. Permanent grassland remained an effective filter protecting the groundwater. If rainfall played a driving part in the nitrate leaching, flooding seemed to have almost no influence.	water;nitrate
254	Mechanical interactions between a falling bock and external obstacles. At the present time there is a real tendency to fight natural phenomena, which are sometimes not foreseeable, by using systematic accuracy in both the analysis and management of the risk associated with rockfall. In particular, frequent rockfall occurrence has resulted in the development of passive protection methods such as rockfall restraining nets. These are specific structures, located below rocky cliffs, to protect both people and infrastructures. Designing of these structures requires to describe both the trajectory of the boulders, and their interaction with the protective structure. Furthermore, rockfall analysis should encompass the description of the interaction between boulders and natural ground and forest stands. This paper gives significant insight about both experimental and numerical modelling of interaction between a falling block and external obstacles. Application to the design of rockfall protective structures is thus discussed.	rockfall
255	Study of simplified tools for the physical characterization of farmyard manure and compost. As soon as the operator wishes to realize attempts or tests of spreading with manures and composts, he is confronted with the difficulty in evaluating the physical characteristics of the products. Today there are tools or methods, sometimes standardized, to estimate the dry matter rate, the density, the shear strength, the presence or not of long vegetable bits... But none of these individual measurements makes it possible to qualify the product overall and their implementation is long and complicated. It is the association of several of these data, which can provide an appreciation of the physical properties of the product used. A synthetic tool, which would provide aggregate information, at the time of its employment, gathering several of the simple parameters of characterization would be very useful. It is what we sought in this study, using the measurement of the effort necessary to extract from the product to spread.	
256	Field experiment to assess pesticide post-application transfers to the atmosphere. About determining volatilization fluxes. The consideration of pesticides in atmosphere is recent in France. And it doesn't exist surveillance program of atmospheric contamination by pesticide products as it exists for other industrial pollutants (ozone, NOx...). Indeed it is not of quantifying a unique pollutant but more than 500 different active materials in about 7000 commercial formulations. It is imaginary to believe that the next years will see being born a universal method allowing to measure all the susceptible pesticides to be present in the atmosphere. We turn more credibly to the development of mathematical models for the estimation of fluxes transfers of pesticides towards the air compartment from the treated surfaces. These last ones coupled with distribution and deposit models will allow to estimate contamination levels according to removal from sources. Three different phenomena are at the origin of the presence of pesticides in the air. The departures in the atmosphere are made from treatments (spray-drift); then by eolian erosion from treated grounds (contaminated dusts) and by more complex phenomena (transfers under gas phase and co-distillation). The development of mathematical models of transfers of pesticides since the treated surfaces passes by understanding the phenomena of transfers and the identification of the factors that control them. The nature of the ground, the climatic conditions during the application and the physico-chemical properties of compounds are so many factors, which influence mechanisms and importance of these departures towards the atmosphere. LERES (Laboratoire d'étude et de recherche en environnement et santé) developed a technique of trapping and analysis of some compound presents in the air. It is based on a trapping of compounds on a resin, then a thermal desorption before analyze by GC/MS. This technique, which allows to treat quickly a great number of samples, allowed us to determine a vertical gradient of concentrations of two herbicides, atrazine and alachlore, applied on maize, during 4 days following the treatment. Coupled with micrometeorological measures, these data allow to determine fluxes of transfers.	pesticide;concentrations
257	Lysimeter study of the effect of a vegetative buffer compared to maize and bare soil on the leaching of atrazine and DEA.. The efficiency of a vegetative buffer strip to reduce pesticide leaching is poorly understood. Using lysimeters (2m*2m*1m) filled with a silty soil, we compared the effects of rye-grass, maize and bare soil. Leaching was monitored for an application of 250 g/ha of atrazine, which is more than would arrive in run-off. The treatments were compared under irrigations, with equal drainage, equivalent to 350 mm in 5 months, allowing the overall effects of differences in dissipation and preferential transfers on leaching to be estimated. Aerial rye-grass and maize residues were exported, to investigate the effect of root system principally. The results show that under the conditions of this experiment the rye-grass root system enhances the purifying power of the soil and suppressed the leaching of atrazine and partly that of DEA. For the DEA, less adsorbed, a risk of leaching may occur when the pesticide is highly available on the soil surface under the conditions of rapid transfers. The maize had no better purifying effect than bare soil. The effectiveness of rye-grass is attributed to dissipation, due to the large root biomass in the 0-30 cm layer. The value of a grassed strip is greater for weakly adsorbed molecules.	pesticide;atrazine
258	Evaluation of the growth, shape and wind resistance of Douglas-fir plantations from seedlings and cuttings. Three trials including Douglas fir cuttings and seedlings, located in Limousin, were observed just after the storm in December 1999. Damages are not more important on cuttings than seedlings from the same origin, as mean growth is equivalent for the two materials. Damage on trees increase with height growth in the same origin, but depends on clone, independently of the height growth. Generally height growth/dbh ratio on cuttings is higher than seedlings, as branching is poorer, but differences exist between origins. Results are discussed in the future of a storm tolerance better integrated in the future Douglas-fir varieties.	
259	Evaluation of the potential fish production of ponds. Information about the potential production level of a fertilized fishpond are indispensable for its rational management. For fisheries, various methods are existing to correlate fish-biomass and -yield of lakes to their morphometry, physico-chemical and biological parameters. Such methods proved to be inappropriate for the fertilized fish-ponds studied by the authors in France (36 different locations). This can be explained by the peculiarities of such water bodies: strong anthropication, low diversity of the stocked (cultivated) fish species, optimized fertilization. From the data collected by the authors, statistical treatment evidenced links between phytoplankton types, chlorophyll densities and fish production levels. Combining both five typical groups of phytoplankton and five different concentrations of chlorophyll a arranged into a grid, it is possible to determine the potential fish production of the ponds (up to over 500 kg/ha).	fish;fisheries
260	Assessing the environmental quality of agricultural spreading: a new approach using life cycle assessment. Quality of agricultural spreading processes depends both on the spreader performances and fertilizing elements behaviour. This dual aspect can be examined through a Life Cycle Analysis (LCA), especially considering the operational stage of the life cycle where the quality of application will influence the amount of emissions. LCA is an effective method of accounting for the environmental benefits and burdens of the production of goods and services. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the environmental impacts of three fertilizing scenarios: application of mineral fertilizers, liquid manure and solid manure. The environmental categories assessed were: climate change, acidification, eutrophication and terrestrial toxicity. Emissions related to the tractors operation are lower than emissions induced by mineral and organic fertilizers application. Ecodesign has an important issue in reducing environmental impacts by improving application quality and developing manure injection.	agricultural
261	"Evaluation of the safety of ""authorised"" dams. Cemagref was asked by the French Ministry for the Environment to assess the safety of, and the monitoring and maintenance programmes for, dams which come under the Ministry's authority. In total, 361 dams spread over 67 French departments were inspected. The dams fulfil a variety of functions including drinking water supply, irrigation water supply, flood control, low water level maintenance and sports and recreation. For the most part, the dams are owned by many widely dispersed owners, without any specialist expertise in dams technology, unlike in the case of hydroelectric dams which are used and managed by a few highly specialised organisations. Despite a dam restoration and upgrading programme, which has been running for some twenty years, several dams still do not fully satisfy so-called modern design criteria, in particular with respect to floodwater evacuation capacity, overall dam condition and stability. In addition, the monitoring and assessment of these structures needs to be markedly improved."	irrigation water
262	Assessment of the vulnerability of masonry buildings subjected to avalanche loadings. Since last decades, mountainous areas have assumed great importance for tourism and the economy. Infrastructures were set up in regions where avalanche risk is likely to exist. Thus, the assessment of the vulnerability of infrastructures is now regarded as a major challenge. This paper is devoted to the case of masonry buildings, which are submitted to dynamic out-of-plane loadings. An original numerical approach, which is based on the discrete element method, is proposed. This approach has allowed an engineering tool for vulnerability assessment to be developed.	masonry;avalanche
263	Assessment of groundwater quality recovery strategies using nitrate transport modelling. Application to the Saône alluvial formations (Tournus, Saône-et-Loire). To assess the efficiency of different agro-environmental strategies used to reduce groundwater pollution by nitrates, transport modelling in soils and groundwater has been carried out on two withdrawal areas in an alluvial plain. In a first time, the agro-environmental model AgriFlux allowed the simulation of water and nitrates fluxes flowing to groundwater. This model was calibrated for each agro-pedological unit of the studied territory. In a second time, the application of the hydrogeological model MODFLOW-MT3D allowed the simulation of nitrate transport in groundwater for the 1980-2004 period. This soil-groundwater coupled modelling has shown that soil nature is the first factor that conditions the vulnerability to nitrates. Thus, nitrate leaching occurs preferentially under sandy soils. Efficiency of different agro-environmental operations for groundwater quality recovery was quantified. The best results are obtained by combination of (1) grassland re-installation on sandy agricultural lots located in near well protection perimeter and (2) fertilization reduction on sandy agricultural lots located in the well alimentation area upstream the near protection perimeter. On other soils, the effect of grassland on groundwater quality improvement is more limited. Nevertheless, the control of nitrate fertilisation remains essential and is justified in both near and far well protection perimeters. Modelling thus allows optimising and priorizing agro-environmental actions in alluvial agricultural zones.	nitrate;water;agricultural;efficiency
264	Evaluation of solutions put in place by local authorities to reduce the quantities of biowaste in residual household waste. The objective is to estimate the relevance of the solutions organized by Communities to reduce the quantities of residual household waste (RHW) and particularly the biowaste in this waste. This assessment is established for three methods of biowaste management. These methods are the collection of biowaste, the composting near the centre of the village and the individual home composting with a composting bin. The method of evaluation is to measure several indicators such as the quantities per hour or kilometre on collection, the rate of presentation of bins at the collection, the production per inhabitant, established during the collection. The over indicator is the nature of the residual waste and separated collection on detached house sectors by the characterization before and after the implementation of the system in the area.

This work shows the valuation of salmon angling recreational benefits expected from the dam removal on the Sélune river. We propose a methodology based on the notion of ""direct benefit transfer"". The fishing effort variation is estimated through statistical models and overall benefits are aggregated using transferred unit values for recreational benefits. Our results show that the surplus gain might be close to 400 000€ per year for our most conservative hypothesis. This gain is of 840 000€ if the Sélune river is valued as a river from the west of the USA."	salmon angling;hydroelectric dams
266	Evaluation of the effects of agricultural practices on nitrogen fluxes at the scale of an intensive husbandry watershed. One of the reasons for the deterioration in the water quality in Brittany is the effluent discharged from stock breeding farms. To optimise the management of this waste, methods for analysing and assessing agricultural practices were drawn up and applied in a 6 km2 catchment area in North Finistère with intensive stock breeding (beef and pigs) with levels exceeding the limits. The aims were to quantify the levels of nutrients (N, P) and to propose and assess changes in farming practices that would reduce these levels, in particular in water. The 12 pig units studied revealed very marked differences in breeding performance, feeding practices and therefore in nitrogen and phosphorus levels in the effluent. The introduction of feeding practices that were less damaging to the environment, such as two phase feeding for pig farms, would considerably reduce nitrogen and phosphorus levels in effluent. However the scope for improvement varies considerably depending on the farm. Levels in cattle farms were also excessively high and considerable improvements could be made in particular by better pasture management. The annual excess nitrogen level, calculated from individual plots, was 210 kg/ha. It was found in the soil in autumn and for the whole winter. Better fertilisation management could be expected to reduce the nitrogen level by 25%. There was very little room for improving the phosphorus level as the soil already had a high phosphorus content. Nitrogen losses, estimated using the NBVI model from soil measurements, were higher for annual crops than for pasture. We were able to link nitrogen levels in the soil in this basin with output flows using a relatively simplified model. The excess nitrogen was reduced by 40% in the outflow. This considerable reduction applied to agricultural ground (denitrification/metabolisation) and also underground water (about 18% of the excess), probably in the wetlands, which cover 23% of the area of the basin. However, upstream as well as downstream, the current structure of the basin is not conducive to their action as there is a dense drainage network and deep ditches which channel the water that is most heavily loaded with nitrates coming from the unsaturated zone.	agricultural;water;pig
267	Evaluation of environmental impacts of farming practices at the field and farm scale to elaborate actions plan: a diagnosis geographic method, based on indicators: DAE-G. From 2000 onwards, Picardy Chambers of Agriculture (northern France) initiated an RD project aimed at designing an innovative approach to quality and environmental management on farms, which would enable the continuous improvement of farming practices. This project led to the creation by Agro-Transfert of a geographic, agri-environmental diagnosis method named DAE-G. This was created in collaboration with INRA research council, Picardy Chamber of Agriculture and Institute LaSalle Beauvais, and funded by from Picardy Region and ADEME (environment and energy management agency). Combined with a geographical information system, this diagnosis tool enables field-scale quantification of the environmental risk, based on interaction between environmental sensitivity and farming practices. The farmer has an overview of his farm with distinction of areas the most at environmental risk. The input data required to calculate the indicators are sourced from the farmer and from any existing document about the characteristics of the soil. DAE-G method addresses environmental themes on both the field scale (nitrate water pollution) and the farm scale (biodiversity, waste management, etc.). For each of these themes, a group of experts (researchers and agricultural advisors) determined the indicators needed the aggregation method of input data, calculation methods and reference thresholds for each indicator. After two years of use, DAE-G has been used on about 200 farms. Every farmer has detailed diagnostic report and support to improve his farming practices. Not all environmental diagnoses are performed for the same reason. In fact, DAE-G is used in environmental management with volunteer farmers but is also applied to watersheds' studies to improve the quality of ground water by reducing diffuse pollution by nitrates and pesticides. It is this case of DAE-G's use that will be studied in this presentation of the catchment area whole field's results. A zoom on a winter common wheat culture field will be made to present and interpret DAE-G's results on the field scale. The use of a method of environmental diagnosis for several uses at different scales (field, farm, water basin) raises the question of parameter settings (data input, thresholds). Indeed, DAE-G is also used on catchment area scale in addition than of field's scale. As for DAE-G, any diagnosis method raises the question of its relevance for a case of use, which it was not conceived for.	farmer;agriculture;environment
268	Evaluation of the performance of manure spreaders: first results according to the NF EN 13080 standard. This article is based on a study financed by the ADEME, whose objective is to evaluate the performances of organic matter spreaders in accordance with European standard, EN 13080, Manure spreaders - Environmental protection Requirements and test methods. It explains criteria of requirements of the standard, the difficulties of implementation, and shows the results. The main characteristics of the spreaders (selected among the most representative in the market: 6 with vertical beaters and 3 with disc), are presented. We also describe the used products: manure and compost. The phase of presetting, allowing to obtain spreading of 30 tons/hectare for manure and of 15 tons/hectare for compost, confirms the interest of this calibration and indicates progress to be carried out in order to obtain the right amount. It also point out the lack of information and the inaccuracy of the adjustments. The step of evaluation is developed in two stages in order to judge separately 2 qualities of the distributions: -transversal, and - longitudinal evenness. The presented results indicate the levels of performances of the spreaders for each criteria, C.V. (variation coefficient) and working width, for transverse distribution, C.V. and stretch in the tolerance zone for the longitudinal distribution. Finally, fixtures of the performances of the spreaders are established by taking, as level of acceptability, all the simultaneously satisfied criteria, such as indicated by the standard.	
269	Evaluation of agricultural phosphorus losses by runoff, drainage and leaching in a Quebec context: application of the LoPhos tool. Often neglected until now in the environmental budget of agricultural activities, phosphorus more and more appears as a potential important contaminant as well for the surface water as for ground water. Easily and rapidly adsorbed by clay particles, phosphorus wasn't very found in water resources despite application rates sometimes excessive, such as with liquid manure spreading. However, because a continuous and significant spreading on sometimes limited agricultural areas, a saturation of soil can be reached and losses of phosphorus may then be as large as the application rate. For that, Quebec has developed innovative techniques to quantify and survey the phosphorus soil saturation. Among them, LoPhos is a tool that evaluates the phosphorus losses over an agricultural farm from easily available data. An application of this tool on a watershed of Quebec is presented in this paper showing the importance of the soil saturation and the impact of best management practices. The transposition in France of the knowledge developed in Quebec and such tool like LoPhos offer interesting perspectives when appears at present a phosphorus problematic related to the spreading of farming effluents.	water;agricultural;agricultural phosphorus;phosphorus;agricultural areas;france
270	Evaluation of evaporation losses during sprinkler irrigation in conditions of high water deficit. Evaporation losses during irrigation are evaluated on the basis of literature results and using two simple methods. The first method focuses on the advection phenomenon while the second deals with the additional evaporation induced by air saturation. For extreme climatic conditions, both propose evaporation losses of around 15%. The latter is in agreement with some pertinent literature results. Under such conditions and for water saving purposes, irrigation shortages should be recommended from 11am to 15pm and from a general point of view, irrigation should be avoided when the wind speed reaches the threshold value for the used irrigation system. Under usual conditions, these losses are much lower than 10% during irrigation using water application depths in the range of 30 mm.	water;irrigation;sprinkler irrigation
271	Evaluation of animal nitrogen emissions in municipalities of the Brest bay area watershed. This note presents the results of a study, which updates the results of the RGA (General Agricultural Census) of 1988 for effluents of animal origin, based on various statistical sources of departmental or communal data from 1993. The results show that while the pig population in the area studied is increasing in the same proportions as in the rest of the Finistère or at regional level, broiler chicken or turkey production is growing faster. The result is a significant increase in nitrogen emissions from the latter farms, which more than compensates for the decrease in bovine nitrogen emissions.	nitrogen;pig population;animal;animal nitrogen emissions
272	"Assessing the risks of nonpoint nitrogen pollution from agricultural sources on the scale of catchment areas: advantages of a modelling approach with SWAT®.. Decisions on water quality issues are usually made on large territories ranging hundreds to thousands of km². The challenge for decision makers is to better understand the interactions between agriculture, the physical environment and water quality. The SWAT® model is a tool for combining those relationships. We will present here its implementation on two test watersheds in the region of ""Pays de la Loire"": the ""Moine"" watershed (385 km²) and the ""Rochereau"" watershed (206 km²). We outline difficulties linked to data availability. The model can predict relatively well flows and nitrogen fluxes at the catchment scale. Mapping nitrogen pollution risks due to agricultural activities becomes possible. As a result, one can differentiate among the different factors participating in the overall Nitrogen fluxes (agricultural practices or physical characteristics). This modelling experience brings interesting opportunities to simulate the effects of changes of the practices and use of the land on water quality."	water;nitrogen;agricultural
273	Evaluation of the cost of implementing agricultural practices to limit runoff erosion: the example of farms on the Neubourg plateau. The study carried out answers a real question of a local community who wishes to reduce the run-off causing flooding by supporting agronomic measures. We suggest an evaluation of the cost of farming practices showing its variability depending on defined parameters and drawing a parallel with the existing subsidies. From a field study, it consists in providing the elements for decision for the community to assess the level and nature of the compensation necessary to encourage some practices resulting in the limitation on erosive run-off in the scope of the watershed. Three practices are selected: cover cropping, grass ley and mechanical weed control.	flooding;agricultural
274	"Assessment of irrigation infrastructure costs. An efficient management of subsidies for the irrigation sector requires some knowledge on infrastructure costs. If a mean to access to such efficiency would be the calculation of the full cost of water resource mobilization, the assessment of the "" financial "" cost, which does not integrate externalities, is an intermediary step. In this paper, we propose a definition and a calculation method for this "" financial cost "", which moreover enables both public authorities and managers to better understand the composition of this cost and its distribution among users. To illustrate the method, we apply it to five irrigation networks, chosen so that they may be representative of a majority of French systems. We give the details of the different components of the computation, and we compare the outcome to the price of water the user pay. We give also the limits of such a comparison. A cost-sensitivity analysis is done relatively to the discount rate we use and to the service life of the facilities."	water;irrigation;efficiency
275	Evaluation of the transfer of heavy metals to surface water: The case of revegetation of alpine ski resorts. Vegetalisation aims to insert harmoniously derelict land into landscape and to reduce erosion with establishment of plant cover. Classically, method consists to hydroseed fertilizer and seed. Soil reconstitution, a preliminary condition for hydroseeding, develops in mountain resorts for few years. Typically, the application of sewage sludge compost on ski tracks has a application of about 55 tons per hectare. There are currently no soil restoration regulations in France. In this context, we examine transfer elements in the superficial hydrosphere. The results show that terracing as well as certain revegetation practices (autumn fertiliser spreading) can lead to significant transfers of heavy metals to surface waters, particularly during critical snow melt periods. This work can be perceived as an initial study than needs to be continued.	ski;alpine ski;fertilizer
276	Economic evaluation at the scale of small catchment areas of the introduction of less polluting practices on farms. Example of nitrogen pollution. The work described here quantifies the cost of introducing less-polluting methods into the farms situated in two small catchment areas, one dedicated to livestock and the other to crop farming. The method enables both the items that cause pollution emissions and the principal obstacles to their reduction to be identified for each farm production system. Taking such items into account in the solutions adopted, which is necessary because two farms within the same production system can generate widely differing levels of pollution, enables an extrapolation to several well-known farms in each small basin.	
277	Evaluation and cartography of the faunistic potentialities of a territory: the example of the territory of Gap and its avifauna. Within the framework for the environmental charter and the revision of its Local Town Planning (PLU), the city of Gap wishes to consolidate its environmental policy. It needs decision-making and management tools allowing a better integration of ecological and landscape data in its territorial actions. Thus, the city of Gap will equip all technical and engineering units with a Geographical Information System (GIS). The city of Gap request was a methodological and technical exploration of the possibilities offered by the GIS in the ecological and landscape management. This program of operational research is integrated in a logic of sustainable development. This research contributes a methodological and technical share with the implementation of an environmental policy for a reasoned development of the Gap territory. It is defined as an innovating experimental step, complementary to the current policies of the city of Gap. This article is restricted at the biodiversity part of the total research. It explains the development of an evaluation and of faunistic cartography of the potentialities of a landscape method. The example used is Gap's avifauna.	research
278	Evaluation and cartography of the risk of forest fires - Towards an application at the Massif des Maures (in the South East of France) on the scale of the Plans for the Prevention of natural Risks (PPR). In the Mediterranean area, 10 000 to 60 000 ha of natural field are burnt every year. As a result, it is a permanent threat for goods and persons safety and for natural resources protection. So fire hazard prevention remains an important objective for the local communities, the State and the European Commission in the Mediterranean countries. In this context, the team « Forest Fire protection » of the Cemagref of Aix-en-Provence, developed a spatial analysis method to estimate forest fire hazard on the Maures Mountains (Var Department). The objective was to establish a cartography of the areas of same sensibility to fire. The change to a more accurate evaluation and cartography (particularly at the scale of the Risk prevention Plans) leads to questioning the implementation details of this method. The method proposed here proceeds in three steps, qualifying and mapping the areas of ignition, the areas of initial propagation of fire and the areas of free propagation. For each step, we make some hypothesis. The factors retained at the Mountain scale are analysed at the scale of 1/10 000. Some factors are combined in intermediate indices: that is the case for the vectorial combination of wind and relief. Limits are determined from expert knowledge and literature. Those limits correspond to different hazard levels. The results take the form of a determining key. A cartographic example is given after simulation on a Geographic information System.	prevention of natural risks
279	Evaluation and Spatialization of GAseous Emissions from farmyard manure Management (ESEGA): from inventory to testing of gaseous emissions reduction technologies. An original approach of construction of an information system applied to the assessment of NH3, N2O and CH4 gas emissions at the various stages of livestock manure management based on the mass-flow concept is herein presented. The tool ESEGA corresponds to the combination of a relational database dedicated to calculations and a Geographical Information System (GIS) in order to provide dynamic cartographies of the results. This tool of decision-making aid appears well adapted for a realistic assessment of the gaseous emissions and for the evaluation of mitigation strategies, with single or combined techniques. The evolutionary possibilities of this tool enable to consider new applications and uses at several space scales.	
280	Piping flow erosion in dike: quantifying the failure time. The piping flow erosion process, involving the enlargement of a continuous tunnel between upstream and downstream, is a major cause of dike break. Such a pipe can be imputed to roots or burrows. The coefficient of erosion must be known in order to estimate the remaining time to failure and to downstream flood. The Hole Erosion test is a laboratory experiment especially suited to estimate a priori this geotechnical parameter. We propose therefore simplified expressions for the remaining time to breaching accounting for this erosion parameter.	erosion;accounting
281	Evolution of the objectives and the principles of intervention of rural development policies on the long-term. Just like rural areas themselves, rural development policies have undergone a radical change over the last decades. This text presents the rural development concepts included in these policies, their processes, their intervention instruments and the strategies that they can promote. It insists on the fact that this evolution is not linear. With the objective of reconciling fairness and efficiency, rural development policies continually oscillate between support for the evolution of the agricultural sector, aiming at a more global and integrated development of a homogeneous rural territory, creating a synergy between rural territories and urban dynamics at the regional scale.	evolution;rural areas
282	"Extension of a guide for the identification of forest sites: use of National Forest Inventory data. An example of application to the borders of the ""Gâtinais Oriental"". The IFN (French National Forest Inventory) floristic and ecological data were used to extend the validity area of a guide for forest types identification. The studied case concerned the «Gâtinais oriental» and «Puisaye des plateaux» added to the «Pays d'Othe» and the «Champagne sénonaise». With a bibliographic study, phytoecological surveys realized during the the development of forest types catalogues by Cemagref and new surveys in «Gâtinais oriental», IFN data allowed to :- reveal the similarity between the regions ;- specify the frequency and diversity of ecological characteristics, particularly trophic and hydrous features, in each region. The IFN data are as rich in information as those of the initial catalogues. In all, 1852 phytoecological data were gathered in a database. Their representation in ecograms (acidity and soil humidity) appeared to be much more pertinent than the only example-types published in the initial catalogs in order to give useful information about the possibility of extension of the validity of the guide in the four regions."	
283	Factors affecting the longevity of sub-surface Horizontal Flow systems operating as Tertiary Treatment for sewage effluent. Compared with other forms of domestic wastewater treatment, reed beds require very little in the way of operational and maintenance input. This is even more markedly the case with Tertiary Treatment systems [than with Secondary Treatment systems] where the necessary maintenance amounts to only a few days/year. Unfortunately, in practice this frequently results in them receiving little or no attention at all. Tertiary Treatment Reed Beds are not a fit and forget solution but they are often treated this way because they are very forgiving and abuse-tolerant. After a number of years a few of these tertiary reed beds have deteriorated to an extent whereby they are close to failing to comply with the regulator's requirements. Severn Trent Water Ltd has recognised this situation and has committed a budget for a programme of reed bed maintenance. This work has started with a survey of the condition of their beds and particularly to determine the common problems and hence the maintenance regime required. Five main problems occurred either singly or in combination namely: a) Sludge deposition; b) Above surface flooding [partially caused by a), c), and d) ]; c) Inlet flow distributor problems / clogging; d) Outlet collector problems / incorrect level; e) Weed infestation.	water
284	Supporting stakeholders' awareness and engagement for local land planning: the Thau territory experience. Opening land-planning public policies to new actors and citizens faces indifference or even some suspicion. One of the main challenges for practitioners of participatory approaches is to strengthen citizen awareness and local stakeholders engagement. Through two examples based on a research partnership for the development of the Thau territory, we show how the use of geographical tools (3D physical models and participatory mapping) can help meet these challenges during the diagnosis phase of the land planning process. Despite their apparent simplicity, these tools have demonstrated their potential to achieve the objective: 3D models by bridging the gap between the technical aspects of the planning project and the sensitive experience of ordinary citizens, participatory mapping by promoting and legitimizing local knowledge.	
285	"Purification systems for small collectivities: attached growth cultures on fine media. France counts a large number of communities with less than 2 000 inhabitants. The adjustment of wastewater treatment plants, easy to implement and to use, needed by these rural communities, enlarges the number of processes already widely used, such as waste stabilization ponds and activated sludge. The purpose of this article is to describe five wastewater treatment systems called ""attached-growth cultures on fine media"". A high and reliable quality level is obtained by supplying very small organic loads and an alternate feeding of the reactors leading to a self-regulation of the fixed biomass (these treatment plants don't have any secondary settlement tank). The effluent's quality reaches 125 mg.L-1 in COD and 25 mg.L-1 in BOD5. A high nitrification is obtained (NK-N < 10 mg.L-1). Nitrate contents are variable depending on feeding cycles. A reliable functioning is obtained thanks to a regular operation with a reasonable cost."	france;purification;fine
286	Torcy-Vieux dam (71 France) sampling, tests and results on geotextile filters. The Torcy-Vieux dam is a homogeneous earthfill dam, which was built around 1800. There were several phases of construction interrupted by incidents and repairs. In 1987, the last one consisted in logging trees on the downstream slope, boring 12 drainage wells on the downstream toe and building a downstream shoulder of about 4 m height, with drain wrapped around with geotextile filters. In 1997 an inspection operation noticed seepages on the superior part of the downstream slope. A more acute analysis came to the conclusion of a high risk of internal erosion and clogging of the drain geotextile filters. In august 1998, the pulling down operation of the downstream shoulder gave opportunity to take samples and do laboratory tests. Their results are given in this study report.	
287	Flow of nutrients from agriculture to the roadstead of Brest. Nitrogen and phosphorus are used in large quantities for agriculture to increase production. A part of them is then found in water where they can increase eutrophication. Nitrogen and phosphorus transfer from agricultural lands and farms to water occur by several ways. Various physical, chemical and biological mechanisms works in those transfer. In order to observ observe, to understand and to quantify them, the Cemagref is studying the Kerouallon, a small watershed in north-west of Brittany, France. Those transfer depend, of course, on agricultural practices, on the characteristics of the basin and on meteorological and hydrological conditions: Nutrients concentrations and flows vary a lot in the stream at the outlet of a basin according to all these mechanisms. In order to quantify nutrients flows from agricultural activity to water, it is necessary to collect data about discharge and concentrations in water with a small and pertinent enough timestep to monitor all the variations. It is important also to put them in relation with hydrological conditions. That is done now on the Kerouallon basin and we will try to use the results now on larger basins.	agriculture;water

This article underlines the importance and the interest of high quality geotechnical studies prior to drinkable water treatment station, the ground foundation nature, the special deep-grouted foundations choice, consisting in injected ballasted columns, the soundings, controls and tests realised on these foundations. We describe the recorded anomalies and pathologies, the arisen questions, investigation complementary tests, the projected reinforcement solutions and the planned mode of repair. The consequences due to these anomalies are approached as well as engineering works of drinkable water treatment station problematics.	water
289	Protection forests to shield from rockfall . The protective role of mountainous forests is often inferred but rarely quantified in terms of forestry management. To address this problem, this study focuses on a wooded slope, which protects a main road against rockfall at Sainte Foy Tarentaise, France, in which the effective role of the existing stand was quantified. The first stage of the research produced a number of clearly identifiable representative profiles, which were then used to supply forest stand data for input into a trajectory calculation program. Simulations were then produced for both positive and negative stand development to identify multi-functional management solutions. This work opens up new directions for both research and development works.	research
290	Forest seeking owner for a sustainable relationship: study on private forest in Sologne, France. While the forest management concept is being redefined and new forest orientations appear, how is the landowner going to adapt to all these facing challenges? Sologne, a natural entity in France covered by private forests, represents a pertinent field of study. Based on a qualitative interview method, we elaborated a typology of the forest owners in Sologne, which highlights six major 'forest attitudes'. To evaluate the potentialities of sustainable forest management, we have to enlarge our analysis to all stakeholders, study their interactions and their impact on the ecosystem. Sologne on the way to sustainability? Yes, under certain conditions...	france
291	Formalization of a method for delimiting wetlands according to the criteria of the Water Law: application to the Burgundy region. The government plan of action for wetland safeguard and recovery in France has been translated, in Burgundy and following the DIREN's initiative, by the working-out of specific terms and conditions which set down an inventory principle, resting on the eligibility criteria of the second article of the law about water. On the basis of such precepts, we have developed a specific method about wetland inventory. Mainly technically speaking, the inventory method is made of two stages. The first one, the analytic one, consists of a stratification of the area, centered on the distribution and space variability of the ecological factors, which can generate wetland. This model stage constitutes a pre-map-making and prepares land prospections, that is the second stage of the inventory. The land analysis is a means to test the reliability and sturdiness of the models, which had been carried out and leads to the creation of the definitive wetland map-making. On an experimental basis, we have coupled this method together with an experimental map-making thanks to satellite multidate images in order to make wetland maps of liable to flooding land of the Saône and Doubs valleys. The quality of the results is encouraging and foreshadows a possible generalization of this tool for wetland inventory.	water;wetlands;flooding;france;space;ecological
292	Forms of territorialisation of public policies in rural areas - The case of qualification contracts in a Rhône-Alpes territory . Adapting public policies to particular local territorial conditions is becoming a major preoccupation. This paper sets out to explore the subject by means of a case study enabling us to identify ways of adapting measures that were not originally intended for them to be applied to specific geographical territories. We demonstrate that the key factors enabling this type of procedure to be effective are the role played by local government officials and the underlying philosophy behind the policy in relation to the nature of the problems to be solved locally.	rural areas
293	Local fruits and vegetables: producers facing the expectations of consumers and distributors. In the fruit and vegetables sector, the producers develop strategies of differentiation based on geographic origin, in order to valorize typical rural areas (« terroirs »). Investigations among consumers show the very positive image of typical rural areas. Interviews among persons in charge in food distribution firms show that products from typical local areas are well integrated into quality strategies of these firms. The article presents the limits encountered to valorize those products and the consequences for the producers. Some results are given about the role played by logistics to help the producers to structure the local collective strategies. Some prospects are proposed concerning the conditions of development for these products and for the future of the involved territories.	vegetables;rural areas;local areas;local fruits and vegetables
294	Ecological engineering against marl erosion in the Southern Alps. This article first exposes a synthesis about knowledge learnt on the influence of vegetation on erosion in marly lands in the French Southern Alps. The different roles of vegetation, close to the plant dynamics, are presented by relating the stages of the restoration of a degraded marly catchment basin. Here are approached the stage of rehabilitation of the basin with the use of bioengineering works, the stage of plant dynamics and monitoring of the rehabilitated ecosystem, finally the stage of sustainable management with the vegetation perenniality. In the second part, we explain how this knowledge can be used to propose optimal strategies for erosion control by ecological engineering, with intervention recommendations at the different stages of a basin restoration.	ecological engineering;alps
295	Agricultural-ecological management of agricultural lands being abandoned in Provence: context, consequences, methodology and development of a reference system. Like other areas in France, the Haut-Var has been affected by the abandoning of agricultural land resulting in reforestation. Although the causes are known (decline of wine growing in areas whose wine was considered of inferior quality), the consequences are more difficult to establish. The studies concerning this phenomenon turn around three main considerations: the risk for the biophysical environment (erosion and disappearance of biotopes), the risk for the landscapes (their transformation has already begun as shown by an obvious closing of the views), the risks due to physical closing of the environment (factors decreasing biodiversity, risk of fires and their wide propagation). To meet this preoccupation of maintaining the quality of the natural space in Haut-Var, CERPRAM has decided to study the value of this reforestation in the eyes of the various managers of the space, the managing methods which, according to them, would allow countering the risks mentioned above and favour the expression of the values and interests which they find or would like to find in this uncultivated space. The management of these areas oblige us thus to take into account all the cases of reforestation present in Haut-Var. It incites us also to consider solutions to meet the expectations of the various partners and to study a management method actually used on some plots: management by raising sheep. The study concludes by suggestions reconciling the interests of all the actual and future users of these areas.	space;wine;agricultural;environment;france
296	Concerted management of wetlands: are local stakeholders the most suitable? The case of the Little Camargue Gardoise. A certain number of measures have been set up in France to protect wetlands. They are usually initiated by government organisations or nature conservancy associations. They are frequently confronted with opposition from users of these areas (hunters, farmers, etc.) and management problems. With respect to these problems encountered in defining a wetland protection policy, what use are protection measures initiated by local government organisations and what are the likely advantages and disadvantages? In order to answer these questions, this paper presents some results from a case study. In particular, it puts forward a set of conditions required for successful protection and development of wetlands. Local government organisations have a role to play in this field, although action by national government is also necessary.	wetlands;france;nature conservancy
297	"Management of water scarcity: between the negotiated application of the ""drought"" decree and the emergence of local arrangements. On the basis of a national survey with local administration of water affairs and three monographs, this paper questions the implementation of the 1992 drought statutory order in the course of recent events (2003, 2005, 2006), and identifies actors involved. Administration, with the prefect in a central position, holds the main role. Implementation of drought management processes is raising some practical concerns: partition of counties in warning areas, gathering of information on availability of water, definition of thresholds activating the crisis status. Water scarcity management happens to follow a pattern of conflicting cooperation. Each stakeholder involved has a double aim: to get his own objectives taken into account, while giving them a general scope so they gain legitimacy. Locally elected people, who are otherwise rather absent, might endorse a key role in solving this conflict between a search for generality and a necessary adaptation to very local contexts."	water;drought;water scarcity
298	Management of riparian and dike vegetation with safety constrains. This paper deals with the management of riparian and dikes vegetation with the constraints of high flood risk. Constrains and concerns of this management, illustrated by a few examples, are reviewed and explained in the context of ecological engineering. Designing specific management plans requires gathering skills in the fields of ecology, civil engineering, natural area development and socio-economics.	
299	Nitrogen management on Danish livestock farms and the related legislation. The use of mineral nitrogen (N) fertilisers in Danish livestock production systems has increased considerably over this century. Nitrogen losses have increased as N inputs have increased and there has been a lowering of the efficiency with which N is utilized in livestock production. This has lead to an increase in atmospheric pollution by ammonia (NH3) and to aquatic pollution by nitrate (NO3). Leaching of NO3 may cause an enrichment of NO3 in aquifers, which is considered a serious environmental problem, because groundwater is used for drinking water without any pre-treatment. Deposition of NH3 is harmful to a number of natural ecosystems. Much of this pollution has arisen from animal manure because it is not used efficiently for plant production. The principle behind Danish legislation aims to reduce leaching losses of NO3 and volatilization of NH3 by improving the utilisation of N in manure. In this paper we describe trends in N use during this century and the legislation implemented to reduce its loss are described.	livestock
300	Water management and spatial data integration. Managers of irrigation systems require heterogeneous, reliable and spatially distributed information. This provides an application for two technologies: remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS). The approach is based on considerable experience of providing advice and setting up decision making tools for public authorities managing large areas. It is divided into several stages: strategy analysis; determination of success and failure factors; decision process analysis; definition of information products and their use; knowledge of the data and the constraints to develop these products; analysis of the tools to be developed. First of all, an example of applying this method to a specific case of water resources management is described and then the initial results of the approach applied to irrigation system management are presented. The method is focused on a limited number of information products, i.e. the most appropriate for managers' requirements. The aim of this approach is to encourage and help managers to analyse their requirement in terms of information products, to think in terms of decision, management and organisation processes and to develop a geographic information system that meets their requirements. Finally, a specific example of application in Pakistan is described.	irrigation;water;managing

The study group ""Valorising forest extensions of lobed leaf trees with valuable woods in the Cère valley"" (Cantal, France, 1995), presents its results in an attempt to answer two simple questions which landowners frequently ask: Is it possible to valorise forest extensions with lobed leaf trees? If so, what forestry operations will be required? A methodology has been developed to obtain a better knowledge of the populations of lobed-leaf trees and to describe and define simple and practical technical management procedures specific to the various types. Typology proves to be a useful teaching tool in this context (valley clearly identified, favorable stands and lobed leaf trees with valuable woods). This experience confirms the idea according to which a forestry specialist worth his salt is able to observe his forest population."	leaf trees;forest extensions
303	Management of livestock manures in the Netherlands - the current situation. The number of animals in livestock production has increased over the last 2-3 decades considerably. As a result especially on pig and poultry farms mineral surpluses have arisen. To regulate the number of animals manure production rights are introduced. Extension of a farm is only possible if manure production rights from other farms are purchased. The amount of manure allowed for land application is limited on base of its phosphorus content. The period of application is restricted to the growing season of the plants, e.g. March to September. The technique of application is restricted to those giving an abatement on the ammonia emission of a least 50 %. Storage tanks for manure have to be covered with a solid roof. Newly designed livestock buildings can obtain a Green Label, when the ammonia emission is 50 % or less as compared with a traditional system. Central processing of pig slurry has proven to be technical possible but under Dutch circumstances not economical feasible. Manure surpluses on farm level are eliminated by optimizing of the distribution system and feed alterations. The quality of chicken manure is improved by introduction of drying system in the livestock buildings. The central processing of veal calf manure based on water purification techniques is presently very successful with annual capacity exceeding 600.000 tons. The development of techniques, such as reverse osmosis or evaporation, for concentration of low solids containing manure looks so far promising for application on farm or regional level. Future legislation will focus on more tailor-made solutions on farm level. A detailed mineral book-keeping system will be introduced. Losses above the allowable level will be subject to severe taxes. This legislation is currently part of the political discussion.	pig;netherlands;livestock
304	Management of livestock manure in Germany - a brief overview. Livestock is an important part of German agriculture. More than 65 % of the financial proceeds of agriculture are currently made by animal production. Because of the increase in the numbers of animals from 1960 to 1990 on one hand and the rise in intensive livestock farming in some regions of Germany on the other, environmental pollution risks have become more evident. This paper describes the current situation of livestock farming, the main legal aspects concerning manuring and selected research projects. The main emphasis has been put on impacts of livestock on environment, followed by a discussion about useful solutions to prevent pollution risks.	germany;agriculture;livestock;animals
305	Management of livestock manures in the U.K.. Rising levels of water pollution in the 1980s led to the introduction of extensive pollution control legislation in the early 1990s supported by codes of practice specifically targeted at farming practices. Good practice is seen as recycling livestock manures to the land and farmers are encouraged to prepare a manure management plan for their farm, this includes establishing manure quantities, where and when safe spreading can take place, and how much storage is necessary for non-spreading periods. Treatment is not recommended other than a minimum storage period, four months in England and Wales, and six months in Scotland. Mechanical separation is used on some farms to aid management of slurry stores, and to improve handling in irrigation systems. Research at Harper Adams and SAC is centred on developing treatment processes and better nutrient utilisation, and this will help farmers to manage livestock manures in a future when there is likely to be ever-tightening legislation on pollution control.	irrigation;recycling;livestock
306	Management of invasive plants: technical limits and socio-technical innovations applied to the case of Ludwigia. Ludwigia, originated from America, is an amphibian plant with great capacity of colonisation. It proliferates in wetlands. Despite its management in many places, the plant continues to develop. We wonder if the failure of actions against Ludwigia, and we show that technical efficiency is not the only factor to take into account for a good management but that the cultural and social ones are also very important. The example of management with the technique perceive as the most archaic, manual weeding, help us to demonstrate that the innovation process is a socio-technical one for an effective management of the problem.	efficiency
307	"Flood risk management and the ""Inondabilité"" method: a socio-economic perspective. To deal with flood risk management, it is now accepted to consider the risk as the comparison between vulnerability and hazard. The ""Inondabilité"" method uses this concept in order to provide tools for river management. In order to compare the two notions of vulnerability and hazard, we use a discharge-duration-frequency (QdF) hydrological model. It allows the transformation of the two previous components in the same unit and we can finally have a risk map. These results help for an objective negotiation for an adapted river management taking into account many stakes: flood risk but also water resource and environment. We try to show the particularity of the ""Inondabilité"" method, compared to some classical methods used for risk management, especially in the field of economic valuation. The concept of average annual damage cost, as the main estimator of vulnerability, seems not to be very well adapted to the nowadays situation of land use and river management. We prefer an analysis of the maximum acceptable risk that allows a positive management of land use. This approach gives appropriate answers for river management, adapted to local land use and improves the global economic optimum."	flood;water
308	The current situation of the management and disposal of livestock manure in Italy. Livestock production in Italy is mostly concentrated in the North, particularly in the Po Valley where intensive farms account for about 70% of total animal population. In the last decade there has not been a significant increase in the number of livestock produced, but there has been an increase in herd size, especially on pig farms. One consequence of this, is the overloading of fields with animal manure and increasing risks of pollution of drinking water due to leaching of nitrates and eutrophication of surface water caused by run-off of nutrients. In 1995, the environmental regulations of two of the most important Italian regions in terms of livestock production, Lombardy and Emilia-Romagna, were revised and approved. In the spring of 1996, with the consensus of all the Po Valley regions, the Po River Authority issued a directive, which establishes a number of common standards to which all these regions must adhere. These regulations substantially assimilate the EU Nitrate Directive. Among the various techniques for livestock slurry management, spreading after simple storage continues to be the best method and the easiest to implement. However, in the cases in which it is difficult, and sometimes impossible, to find extra land for spreading, farmers must make use of slurry treatment techniques in order to reduce the nutrient load.	italy;water;pig;livestock

The Northern Vosges Regional Natural Park, a biosphere reserve, is covered by 60% of forest. 60% are state forest, 25% belong to communes and 15% are private forest. In 1997 the Cooperation Syndicate for the Northern Vosges Regional Natural Park and the French Forestry Commission (ONF) signed an agreement to organise activities in the field of training, knowledge, forest management, nature conservation, facilities for the public, transboundary cooperation and communication. This paper presents the final results of this agreement with the actions achieved and a critical overview of its implementation. Finally it considers the follow-up of this partnership with various projects.	vosges regional natural park
310	Forest management and ecological engineering. Forestry is a part of Ecological Engineering, for which it could be an archetype. It has created its own tools for ecosystem installation, steering and renewing, through interventions targeted on specific compartments of these complex ecosystems. It has also promoted a two-levelled adaptive management system: management plans and silviculture. These tools may be and should be developed for a cross-scales ecosystem adaptive management, by bringing enough flexibility to the rigid frames inherited from the past forest management, focused on the preservation of timber resource.	
311	Integrated water resources management. The global action plan, Action 21, adopted at the United Nations Conference on the environment and development, in June 1992 in Rio de Janeiro, laid down the principle of integrated water resources management. On the one hand, freshwater should be managed on a global basis, as a limited resource, in close association with the satisfactory operation of water ecosystems and, on the other hand, this management should be better integrated within the framework of economic and social policies, mobilising all institutional, legal, educational and economic means necessary. The main concern is to arrive at a good balance between the knowledge of the operation of the water system, of which the integrity should be preserved, and the intervention of the various water resource users, whose action should be co-ordinated, bearing in mind the common interest, by democratic, open decision making procedures. To preserve the integrity of water systems, it is necessary to identify correctly the functional units within which it is possible to determine clearly the main phenomena affecting the perpetuation of an ecosystem and for which it is possible to define operational management measures. To develop balanced water resources management, best suited to meeting all requirements and uses, it is useful to consider the procedure introduced in France through the Water agencies and Basin Committees, with the new aims associated with setting up water improvement and management plans. An effort should be made to optimise the management of the large amount of information required to represent complex space and time dependent systems and interrelate them with many different users whose interests are often conflicting.	water;environment
312	"Flood risk management: which economic tools to help decision-making?. This text examines the following question: ""Flood Risk Management: Which Economic Tools to Help Decision-Making?"" This question considers only the French case. In the first part we present and analyze the notion of ""decisional context"" as applied in flood risk preventive management. We distinguish and provide an analytic decomposition of two generic types of such a decisional context, namely: centralized decision-making for general interest; decentralized decision-making for common good. This distinction is compatible with several analyses developed on risky activities (conclusions of the European Program Trustnet, reflections of the Society for Risk Analysis...). In the second part, we underline that economics may improve collective decisions. Two typical approaches to help decision-making are quickly presented, namely Cost-Benefit Analysis and Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis. Their adaptation to flood preventive management is discussed. We suggest that improvements derived from these methods depend above all on their accurate adequacy to the ""decisional context"" at hand."	flood;flood risk
313	Forestry and hunting management in natural forests. Motivation of the owners - Example of Sologne du Loiret. Sologne du Loiret has forests over about 40 % of its area and is mainly known for its hunting. Owners are tempted to manage their forests exclusively for hunting, taking into account the revenues they expect from this activity. An alternative should be proposed to them involving a compromise between hunting and forestry by developing techniques improving the value of the forest while preserving the revenues from hunting: planting of fruit trees, spacing of trees, drawing full benefit from the existing species yielding precious woods.	forestry;hunting;trees
314	GIEA: farm information management - Towards a general standardization of the agricultural data for the farm and its economic and institutional partners. In order to satisfy the requests of his economic and institutional partners, the farmer is brought to devote more and more time to collect and transmit all kinds of information about his activity. To increase the difficulty, the information required is generally disconnected from its real practices regarding farms management. This common noting with the agricultural profession led the CEMAGREF during the year 2003 to form a partnership with the Permanent Assembly of the Chambers of Agriculture (APCA) within a project called GIEA (Gestion des informations de l'exploitation agricole) for the farms information management with the assistance of the Ministry of agriculture, foods, fisheries and rural affairs and the Agency for Environment and Energy Management (Ademe). The main objective of the GIEA project is to reach a general standardization of the agricultural data both fulfilling the farmers technical and environmental management needs and the economic and institutional partners requests and more particularly the requirements of the French system of reference for integrated farming. This article presents the prospects opened by this project and explains the methods and strategies that will be implemented to answer the identified constraints and to overcome the difficulties link with the sometimes antagonistic requirements of the various actors.	agricultural

Many agricultural works (sowing, spreading~) require a very precise guidance (about few centimetres in lateral error). Developments showed that the kinematic GPS was a relevant sensor to carry out a guidance system satisfying such level of precision. However the solutions proposed today on the market are limited to the follow of straight lines on flat ground. The research tasks realized by the Cemagref concern developments of control laws improving the response of the guidance system to the disturbances introduced by the presence of slip (works in curve or slope conditions).

History of representations, town and country planning, and crises can give insight into the report of past extreme natural events. So, the collaboration between historical and geophysical sciences is intended to give methodological advances by ensuring continuity of information between past and present, and exhaustiveness of data collection. The 19th and 20th centuries have been chosen as the reference period of investigation to carry out these objectives. Two operational studies, concerning floods (HISTORISK) and avalanches (HISTOVAL), give experience about the interest of historical information, taking into account the quality of data collection, the technical data processing, and their use for promoting risk population sensitiveness.	natural
318	History and memory of forest planning. The history of forest planning is analysed from three points of view. 1) If it is true that foresters are rightfully in charge of forest planning, they have not always been and currently they are not the only ones who deal with issues, which concern more and more stakeholders. 2) When are planning policies altered? Do changes happen in times of troubles or of quiet? When major changes do occur, is there a system, which predominantly accounts for them? 3) How is it possible to understand the fact that numerous alterations take place outside the frame of classical planning regulations and theories?	
319	Identification and notion of organisational costs in local communal services. Case study: the agricultural sewage sludge spreading service. This article analyzes the organization and the costs of the sewage sludge spreading service. Indeed, some costs bore by the sewage sludge mud producers were neglected up to now: assessment costs of spreading environmental impacts, planning and contracting costs (with farmers), miscoordination costs. From a survey carried out near 50 municipalities of the districts of Puy-de-Dome and Haute-Vienne, we show that the level of these organizational costs contributes to explain the choices of the municipalities. Lastly, we stress several policy instruments as well on a central as a local level.	
320	Identifying information needs for assistance on board of tractors. Various types of information are displayed on the tractor dashboard. The amount of information is increasing, so it is important to determine what information is really relevant to the driver. To answer this question, we first have to distinguish the different levels of decision facing the driver and then analyse the information required at each point. An interview-based study has been carried out involving about twenty arable farmers from the Paris basin area. The interviews are based on a list of existing information on tractor dashboards, grouped into three levels identified in the tractor cab. The method used to collect and analyse the data is described. The main results of this exploratory study are then presented.	
321	Dynamic flood retention: time for news dynamics. Integrated Flood Management at catchment scale is the current paradigm. Dynamic Flood Retention is a relevant principle for its requirements, by mitigating floods wherever suitable opportunities exist on the catchment. This article, preface of the special issue, takes stock of the situation on concept, its objectives, advantages and borders.	flood;flood retention;retention
322	Effect of maize cultivation techniques on overland flow and herbicide transport. The effect of tillage techniques for maize crop on herbicide soil surface transfer was analysed at field scale, on two sites, under natural rainfall and using rainfall simulator. The combined strategy for weed control was compared to the classical whole chemical weed control. It induced a decrease in herbicide concentrations and export on the first rainfall events, due to the lower amount spread and tillage that restore initial soil infiltrability. The no-till methods had no effect on concentration but on soil infiltrability and herbicide export compared to the classical tillage, due to band wise mulch planting and decompacting. These cultivation techniques that improve soil surface conditions and infiltration of water are efficient to decrease soil surface transport and herbicide export in surface water.	weed;cultivation;water
323	Impact of climate change on forest productivity and the shift of a bioclimatic limit in the French Mediterranean region. This paper presents the methodological approach used for the study of the impact of climate change on the productivity of Mediterranean forests and the shift of the bioclimatic limit between Pinus halepensis and Pinus silvestris. It also gives some of the main synthetic results of this research, based mainly on dendoecology. The experimental design includes a series of plots distributed along a elevation transect on the north slope of Sainte-Baume mountain. The choice of the site, homogeneous for rainfall regime, as well as the homogeneity in substrata, soil and topography at the level of plots, allows to focus on the variations of the response of trees due to differences in mean annual temperatures. Additional plots with soils much deeper or much more shallow than those of the main transect also allow studying the interaction between climate and soil water balance on the growth of trees. The impact of the exceptional scorching heat and drought of year 2003 is also analyzed. The response of trees to monthly climatic parameters depends a lot on the annual mean temperature and soil water balance. The climate warming should thus produce significant effects on the short-term on forest productivity. While the productivity of the Pinus halepensis strongly increased during the 20th century, that of Pinus silvestris decreased strongly in the same period. Year 2003 reduced directly the growth of these pines. But, especially by its delayed effects on their health status and their leaf area, it limits their capacity of growth for several following years. The productivity of these two pines should be reduced strongly in the next decades. Many withering stands observed in Pinus silvestris distribution area since 2003 show that the survival of large areas of this species is threatened in the short or middle term by climate warming in the PACA region.	climate;climate warming;climate change;productivity;trees;research;water;drought
324	"Impacts of dams on physical and biological environments. Dam settlement in river-beds constitute an obstacle to free-running water and causes a significant transformation to hydrologic regime within the impacted area. This is particularly true for large reservoirs. Such evolutions have great effect on nature and quality of the original biological conditions. It must be mentioned that hydro projects are a response to commercial uses through reservoir capacity and - though - contribute to economical development and social welfare. Unfortunately, they induce also significant trouble to aquatic and semi-aquatic biocenosis. It must be considered of great importance to get from the site and from the project a global knowledge so as to minimise incidences on physical and biological elements, either in normal conditions or during particular events like periodical flush-out of sediments. In the past, such events have induced real ecological catastrophes due to the lack of anticipation on operating schemes. These effects may in fact create considerable prejudice to commercial stakes for which the project was conceived, so as for silt deposits, due to their impacts both on river-beds and outlets of dam conditions. Economical and ecological stakes may in fact tend to a common target, and finally are relevant to a similar operating concept. The present session number 3 is gathering a few history-cases showing geographically changing situations, the diversity of which does yet emphasize some operating principles for multi-uses reservoirs. These situations are of particular interest at the time of transformation for France, of what is called ""General regulations for water uses"" in our European context."	river
325	Environmental impacts associated with the biological treatment and agricultural use of organic waste. Assessment of knowledge for the global environmental assessment of the supply chains. The organic recovery of biodegradable waste intuitively appears to be environmentally sound. However, this assumption in favour of biological waste management is not easy to justify objectively, owing both to the choice of comparison criteria to consider and to the valuation of these criteria. The work presented here aimed at gathering the basic data necessary to perform global environmental assessments (like life cycle analysis) of biological waste treatment. As much as possible, all potential impact categories, along with all different stages of treatment were taken into account, including the stage following land application. The study consisted, firstly in collecting in literature obtainable data on the consumption and rejects of matter and energy associated to this different stages, and secondly in compiling the data retained for each impact factor in a form directly useable in environmental assessment tools. Globally, considering the huge sensitiveness of impact factors to the nature of substrates and to the treatment and background conditions (temperature, soil type), the available data appear to be much too scarce, both in term of on-site data acquisition and of the understanding of the underlying mechanisms.	
326	Sylvicultural implications of reforestation of agricultural land. In 1993, a two-day workshop was held in Edinburgh under the auspices of the European Union's DG VI; the theme of the meeting was the silvicultural impacts of the establishment and first clearings of woodland planting schemes on farmlands. The article provides a detailed account of the areas of discussion, which covered environmental background, the selection of suitable tree species, planting and first clearings, genetic selection and stand management, whilst taking into account the various functions of the woodlands.	agricultural
327	Wildfire and landscape structure: studying links between human activities and natural dynamics to manage fire risk. Urban sprawl provides a model of competitive land use where anthropogenic dynamic and wildland dynamic conflict. It creates a threat at the wildland-urban interface, which affects biodiversity. So, we observe more and more wildfires at these interfaces. For example, In Southern France (region of Bouches-du-Rhône), since 1900, natural lands have been abandoned. Then, they have been colonized by forest species most of them very combustible like Pinus halepensis. Urban sprawl has reduced wildland around Marseille since 1960. Development of two crossed dynamics, urban and wildland ones, are making up a new wildland/urban interface. These interfaces are our subject of study, two questions being considered. Management of urban area ecology consequences: In part, urban pattern depends on choices of housing location. People choose their location according to practical reasons (transportation costs, job opportunities like in Marseille or Aix-en-Provence) and characteristics of area (beautiful landscape, green open spaces etc.). Analysis of urban dynamics needs to characterize forest amenities on interfaces. Moreover, urban pattern is linear or mosaic-like along wildland. This creates a growing fragmentation of this area. Our purpose is to determine the links between urban pattern and wildland communities at different scales. Preliminary results reveal disturbances along urban/wildland interface. Our spatial analysis has made possible a description of the structure of exurban landscape and of urban/wildland interfaces. Moreover results in economics show that residential location factors can be included in an economic model as landscape variables. Risk analysis: Interface vegetation usually consists in coniferous stands. However, vegetation constituting the underbrush has different characteristics, which are modified by human activities and urban patterns. Our purpose is to assess underbrush impact on fire vulnerability, i.e. on fire ignition and spread.	wildfire;fire;natural dynamics;landscape;natural lands;ecology
328	Impacts of the plot structure on the functioning of farms in bocage regions. It is necessary to understand the limits and performances of agricultural techniques, as well as their adaptability and behaviour in the field to ease the dialogue between farmers and their organizations on the topic of management of rural lands. The « Fédération nationale des coopératives d'utilisation de matériels agricoles », in the framework of the « Fonds de gestion de l'espace rural » chose to study the relations between agricultural work conditions and the characteristics of mixed woodland and pastureland type of landscapes, often the subject of discussions, through a new topic: agricultural mechanization and work. This approach at various levels of spatial analysis (plot, farm, landscape) has enabled us to highlight various aspects of farming logics. Through the recording of working times, and through surveys conducted on farmers' practices and choices of production localization within the plot, we have favoured the study in real conditions. However, the modelling proved to be necessary to highlight the impact of some parameters, such as distance. The analyses do not provide standards, but elements of sensibilization of local actors to the question of land improvement integrating farming systems and their evolution for a lasting land management.	agricultural
329	Influence of age and growth rate on the red heartwood of Pinus laricio. Pinus nigra subsp. laricio is greatly valued as a highly productive source of good quality wood. However, the red coloration of the heartwood causes downgrading or considerable output lasses from trunks with a large amount of red heartwood. A study of cores taken at a height of 1.30 m showed that the growth of the heartwood in terms of number of rings is primarily determined by age. The growth of the heartwood and the sapwood measured linearly or by cross-sectional area depends on the age and the speed of growth, which in turn depends on the silviculture rather than conventional forestry provided a major increase in the depth and the cross-sectional area of the sapwood. Introducing heartwood development parameters into growth models should enable the phenomenon to be better understood and should enable the silviculture to be optimised to obtain high quality wood.	wood;red
330	Effect of pruning intensity on the growth in diameter of hybrid walnut shoots.1. Yielding quality timber is possible only if trees are pruned in their young age to produce a straight and knot-free bole (at least when trees are not planted with a high density). Shoots must be pruned as small as possible to avoid decay problems. However pruning can modify tree growth and particularly lead to an increase of shoots diameter growth which counterbalances the objective of pruning only small shoots. This problem appears from a certain threshold of removed leaf volume, which is in part still undetermined. The study reported here aimed to specify the relationship between pruning intensity and shoot diameter growth of young hybrid walnuts in central France. Results showed that pruning can effectively increase shoot diameter growth but with a magnitude depending not only on pruning intensity but also on climatic and growth conditions. Further experiments and modelling tasks will be necessary to end in a more rational pruning management of forest trees.	trees
331	Influence of geopedological conditions on the root system and height growth of Douglas fir in the monts du Beaujolais area (France).. This paper deals with a study of mature Douglas-fir root systems in 74 pure and even-aged forest stands of middle mountain areas (mounts of Beaujolais). Root systems were studied in situ using trenches open in soils at 1 meter distance from the stem of dominant trees. The results stress that geopedological constraints due to substratum and soil structures have a strong influence on root systems morphology, and on height growth of forest stands. Multivariate analyses (CA and HCA) were carried out on root systems variables and geopedological variables. Seven homogeneous groups were identified. They explain 52,6 % of variance of dominant height. Douglas fir height growth is correct or strong for all stands but distinctly reduced when root system is superficial and jammed in surface soil horizons. Highest growth corresponds to deep and regular root system profiles. A multiple linear regression was carried out between dominant height and major root system variables (R² = 0,57 %): estimated maximal rooting depth, maximal root density per horizon, fine roots surface (diameter < 5 mm). Height growth is strongly correlated (R² = 0,61) to surface of finest roots (diameter < 1 mm), which provide the main part of water and nutrients. These observations aim at choosing better sites and soils for settling Douglas fir, and at stressing risks of failure, pests or diseases.	
332	Specificities and complementarities of ecological engineering and restoration ecology. The origin, objectives and applications of ecological engineering and restoration ecology are different. While the former results from the combination of ecological principles with civil engineers know-how, the latter is the result of scientific approaches. Ecological engineering aims at solving an environmental problem based on a good understanding of the living world as well adapted techniques. Its scope is broad and pragmatic. The purpose of ecological restoration is biodiversity conservation by recover-ing viable communities and functional ecosystems. These ambitious approaches are designed on the medium or long term. Both try to assert their originality through specific networks and communication media, whereas they benefit one from the other.	ecology;ecological engineering

In order to lessen the burden of breeding farms and management systems that must control herds, while ensuring space management compatible with a dual function, two Cemagref teams with different skills (electronics, herd management) teamed up for a research project. This project's objectives were to design and experiment herd management technical innovation in the field, electronic herd surveillance, and to specify conditions needed to transfer this innovation into "" practice "" integrated by stockbreeders and other users of this space. This article presents the main results of works carried out in the framework of the "" Reconcile agriculture and the environment "" research program launched by Cemagref."	agriculture;research;space
334	"The floods of September 2002 in the South of France - Hydrological and hydraulic analysis at the Vidourle flood mitigation dams. A major hydro-climatic event occurred in Southern France in September 2002. It was particularly severe on the upper catchment of the Vidourle River in the administrative district of the ""département du Gard"". The reservoirs of the three flood mitigation dams located in that area reached their highest level since they were built in the 60's thus arising interrogations about their safety. We used this significant event to examine the hydrological design studies of the dams. The purpose of the present study was therefore to quantify the hydroclimatic event suffered by the dams. We have tried first to give an evaluation of the occurrence of the rainfall on the catchments controlled by each dam. We have then calculated the hydrographs at the entrance of the reservoirs. Both results were compared with the original hydrological design studies of the dams."	floods;france
335	Water management instruments in France: the example of the Charente region. In France, water pricing and quota systems are the two economic instruments used to manage irrigation water. For example, one water company (Compagnie du Bas-Rhône-Languedoc) bases its tariffs on user demand, another (Compagnie d'Aménagement des Coteaux de Gascogne) combines quotas with water pricing, while a third (Société du Canal de Provence) uses long term marginal cost pricing. A French research institute (Cemagref) is attempting to define the economic instruments best suited to achieve efficient water resources management. In the case of La Charente, a decision has been take to build a new dam in order to increase the water supply (particularly during summer): the institute is seeking an incentive which will induce farmers to continue to use water sparingly, allowing for the physical and social constraints of this catchment area.	water;irrigation water;france
336	Integrating research and management in the context of ecological engineering: interest and limitations. Ecological engineering is defined relative to a scientific field, ecology. How do engineering and ecology relate? In particular, does ecological engineering merely apply the results of scientific ecology? In this note, restricted to the management of continental ecosystems, we insist that scientific ecology cannot be ecological engineering's only source of inspiration, although it has a central place in devising good evaluation procedures (including monitoring) of management quality. We then turn to the concept of adaptive management, which - in its «active» version - promises thorough integration of research and management. We insist on the difficulties inherent in applying this procedure under current conditions, and also propose to test it in several cases.	ecology;ecological engineering;research
337	Intercommunality and natural risks. Legal aspects. Intercommunality is a range of tools, which enables local authorities to pool their competence and their means. As such, it enables action needed for the prevention of natural risks (civil works and various programs) to be carried out jointly. Nevertheless, the relationship between prevention and intercommunality comes up against two limits. On the one hand, the intercommunal structures of the project, which might provide a pertinent view of prevention, are not necessarily those which give rise to a single-minded political will, which is essential for the effectiveness of the preventive action. Moreover, their scale sometimes prevents the taking into account of a problem to do with a risk, which is only common to certain local authorities. On the other hand, the necessary competence of the local authorities in matters to do with the prevention of risk; the power of deciding administrative policy can in no case be transferred to an intercommunal structure.	intercommunality;prevention of natural risks
338	Usefulness of vegetative propagation for the conservation of the genetic resources of elm trees. Different vegetative propagation techniques have been successfully utilized for the ex situ conservation of the genetic resources of the three elm species native to Europe: Ulmus minor, U. glabra, U. laevis. Cuttings are a particularly valuable means to duplicate the material for which some kind of tolerance to Dutch Elm Disease is suspected and needs to be further assessed in susceptibility tests.	europe;trees
339	Very high spatial resolution images and flood risk. The very high spatial resolution (VHSR) aerial or satellite images contribute to environmental studies providing the vision of human size features. To process these thin resolution images, the most efficient approaches are not based on automatic classification any more but on computer assisted photointerpration. This paper presents two applications, which illustrate the potential of these images in the case of flood risk. The first one is related to the vulnerability: the useful objects for management are first classified into 3 hierarchical levels, in order to better compare the interest of VHRS images with the existing geographical data bases and the intermediate resolution images. The second one deals with the characterization of the flood phenomenon through an original use of aerial photographs to obtain the water height for any flooded point. That constitutes a quantitative valorization under GIS of aerial photographs archives and soon, of VHSR satellite images.	flood;flood risk
340	Introduction of conifers - Lessons from the Barillons forest arboretum. The forest arboretum of Barillons was set up in 1924 on the « domaine des Barres » (Loiret - France). Sixteen coniferous species were tested on the site, which is representative of the presently abandoned agricultural land in the Sologne and the Orléanais. Sixty years later, the Cemagref carried out an evaluation of this long-term experiment. The archives allowed us to identify the origins of the species, the planting and the silvicultural conditions. Observations and measurements gave indices on the growth and sanitary state of each species. Among the species tested, Pinus laricio var. Calabrica and Cedrus atlantica were the best adapted to the site. Cedar may therefore be a viable alternative to the Laricio Pine in the plains of Western-Central France. Our results show that assessing the adaptability of exotic species requires long-term input of data. Other arboretums were set up in France in different site conditions and represent a potential source of information about the autecology of forest tree species, which should be better exploited.	france
341	Experimental investigation of flow rates through composite liners at the metric scale. The hydraulic behaviour of 17 composite liners was investigated at the metric scale in the laboratory using 1m diameter cells. A 0.27m thick layer of clay was compacted in all cells. A GCL or a geotextile was also used at the interface in a number of cases. A 4mm diameter hole was drilled in the flat HDPE geomembrane in all experiments. In the cases GCLs were used, the influence of the pre-hydration of the GCL at the beginning of the test was studied. When comparing situations where geotextiles and GCLs were used, results tend to show that even if GCLs incorporate a geotextile the flow rates obtained with GCLs are clearly lower that flow rates obtained in the case there is a geotextile in the interface, even when the geotextile is not fully saturated.	
342	Irrigation and water resource management. Irrigation has been practised in the world for thousands of years but expanded during the 19 and 20 centuries. The practice of irrigation by sprinkler used in France since the second World War has caused a rapid increase in irrigated areas in the South-east (relatively dry climate), the West, Centre, East and North where it compensates for irregular weather patterns. If there are inadequate water resources, there is increased competition for its usage and the natural environment is threatened. Increased efforts are being made everywhere to make the politicians and inhabitants aware of this problem. When new water resources cannot be exploited, the extension of irrigation then depends on possible ways of water economy: modernising the water piping networks, monitoring transport, better control of irrigation techniques and practice, better management of irrigation networks, water resources and usage. Most countries have a water policy and regulations covering this (1993 French water law).	water;irrigation;sprinkler;natural environment
343	Bioindication and macrophytic indices, tools for assessing and diagnosing the quality of watercourses. The bioindication concept, applied to the aquatic vegetation compartment, is covering different approaches, coming from those usually developed through phytosociological and phytoecological methods. They are based on studies about relationships between species forming recognizable units, called syntaxons, or between each species and its environmental factors, linked to its presence and behaviour in the site. In the eighties, needs were precisely oriented to the development of synthetic indices, allowing to quantify eutrophication phenomena. In France, this topic had allowed to boost macrophytes studies, considering their evaluation as a necessary tool for managing aquatic habitats. Some more operational approaches were then pushed up, as functional approaches, in order to analyze the environmental functioning through the populations behaviour, or the study about reference phytocenosis, which are giving standards for comparison to local floristic surveys. In 2001, a synthesis realised by the GIS Macrophytes has allowed to get a view-point about all these approaches, tested or developed in France. Aquatic phytoecological studies led to the publication of a biocenotic index, the IBMR (Biological Macrophytes Index in Rivers). This index is normalised in France from 2003, and is now officially adopted for rivers macrophytes sampling through monitoring networks. These methods have been indeed overtaken, as well as others hydrobiological approaches, by implementation of the European Water Framework Directive in 2000. To meet the new requirements proceeding from the application of this European regulation, works for adaptation and development are intensely set up, as well in using acquired knowledge in phytoecology, than in generating new actual questions, at which the world of science must give pragmatic responses. For that, the new trend and the densification of national monitoring networks, will allow in return to get homogeneous data on a large scale, what have not be done already, in opening new prospects.	water;france
344	"Clarification of action theories, a necessary preliminary stage to evaluate landscape public policies: application to a rural area of Auvergne. This paper is centered on landscape public policies contributing to emphasizing rural amenities. First of all, the authors propose a framework of analysis to classify and clarify action theories of these public policies, because this preliminary stage is essential before evaluating a public policy. After having identified five principal action theories, they point out the one, which is based on the concept of ""environmental service"". Then, this methodology is applied to a rural peri-urban area, located in Auvergne. The authors thus highlight the various forms of public interventions in the field of the landscape on the scale of this zone and they propose a classification of these."	
345	"The co-institution of land management contracts . The analysis concerns land management contracts (CTE), which are the main tool of the multi-functional nature of farming as proclaimed by the French Agriculture Act of 1999. In the Maine-et-Loire department, studies were carried out within the Chamber of Agriculture and the departmental agricultural commission (CDOA) because it is there that standard measures are developed and files are taken under consideration. These are the prime sites for co-determination at a departmental level and, as they are essential to the mechanisms for the development of CTE's, they are not only maintaining but are also increasing their activities of co-construction. However, given the diversity of unions and the arrival of representatives from other social groups, it now appears inappropriate to use the term co-determination. Co-institution appears to render more accurately the concepts of processes and of interrelations that have been observed. The fact that environmental concerns are taken into consideration and that other social groups are included leads to the opening up of agriculture and the reciprocal acculturation of society's various players. Those who criticize the slow pace at which the CTE's are set up are not fully taking into account the cognitive functions of the process. On the pretext of bringing about an ""indispensable simplification"", they run the risk of losing much of the process' pedagogical interest and, in the name of efficiency, of preventing it from being included in the new public land policies, as it should be."	agriculture;maine
346	The setting-up of forest road network plans: a concertation tool for forest stakeholders. In 1997, forest road network plannings covered 3.7 million of hectares representing 28% of the French forest. Only 40% of them take into account preservation of the environment. Moreover, less than a third have a global approach of the forest regarding environment, tourism and fire prevention. Methods to define these plans are either precise and induce a pre-project or consist on global suggestions. However, a great lack of dialogue and circulation of information has appeared. Cemagref proposes a new conception of forest road network planning. The aim of planning building forest road is to develop the country in order to optimise the harvest of wood. This kind of plan depends not only on physical, technical, social and economical points of view, but also on biodiversity and landscape. This approach should widely take into account consultations and dialogues.	environment;forest road network
347	Contamination of surface waters by pesticides: effects on the aquatic environment. The intensive use of pesticides in the environment is a source of contamination of water catchment areas and can have adverse affects on biological organisms. This paper reviews the problems caused by this type of contamination in water by examining the various types of effects - lethal, sublethal, bio-concentration and bio-accumulation - that can be measured in a laboratory or in the natural environment when exposed to various types of crop treatment chemicals.	pesticides;environment
348	Mussels and oysters growth in Brest bay, indicators of water quality and molluscs farming potential. The growth of bivalve molluscs has been selected as a biological indicator of water quality in the bay of Brest (Brittany, western France) thanks to the biology of this group (sedentary living, filter-feeding...) and its importance in national aquaculture. From 1992 to 1995, oysters and mussels have been laid at intertidal and subtidal defined locations, and sampled every third month to assess meat and shell growth. References from other exploited sites in Brittany were added to the comparison. The pacific oysters Crassostrea gigas show two shell affections in Brest bay: an over-thickness, characteristic of tributylstain effect, and a Polydora sp. infestation generating mud blisters. Both symptoms decrease from north to south of Brest bay. The oysters in Roscanvel (nearest site from Brest bay mouth), which site is actually cultivated, can be considered almost normal. The mussel Mytilus edulis productivity of the two sites at the south of Brest bay is moderate (inferior to the best Breton references), while it is exceptionally high in the Elorn north site, the only site where mussels are farmed in Brest bay. This species, less sensible to Tributylstain, seems to take advantage of nutrients from estuaries. As clams and flat oysters suffer from endemic diseases, mussels may be considered as a favourite candidate for mollusc aquaculture in the bay of Brest.	mussels;oysters;clams;france;feeding
349	Physical consistency: a useful tool for sludge characterization for the implementation of European standards. Physical consistency is an important property for sludge characterization, as it affects almost all treatment, utilization and disposal operations. Three physical states have been evidenced for sludge: liquid, paste-like, and solid, whose boundaries are defined by limits of flowability and solidity. Characterization is completed by the evaluation of thixotropic and piling behaviours. In this paper, the work carried out by CEN/TC308 in this field is discussed. For evaluation of flowability, Coaxial cylinder viscometer, Flow cone, Magnesium penetration cone and Extrusion tube viscometer appears the recommended methods, and for that of solidity, Laboratory vane shear, Vicat needle, and Pocket penetrometer. The Penetrometer, coupled to an energy-input system, seems suitable for thixotropic behaviour evaluation, while the Cubic Piling Box (CPB) and the Oedometer for piling behaviour one.	sludge
350	Dissipation of pesticides applied to the soil. Dissipation of pesticide applied to the soil is a function of two fundamental processes: dispersion and degradation. Dispersion is influenced by a combination of transfer processes (volatilization, leaching, water runoff, plant absorption) whereas degradation is characterised by chemical reactions (photodecomposition, hydrolysis...) or biochemical reactions involving soil microorganisms. In addition, the xenobiotic compound and its degradation products may be subjected to sorption processes and become incorporated within residues that are referred to as non extractable. In such a case the compounds are not detectable by conventional analytical methods.	pesticides
351	Territorial dynamics in domestic waste collection and disposal in Brittany and the Pays de Loire region. The management of municipal solid wastes based on the activities of collection and the treatment, which are produced in areas where arrangement is complicated. After focusing on the intercommunality of Brittany and Pays de Loire, we noticed that the situation has been moving since 1992, due to the laws about wastes and intercommunality.	brittany
352	The household packaging sector: from technical and economic modelling to the development of a decision-support tool for collectivities and operators. The selective collection of packaging waste was developed in France during the last decade. The various organisational scenarios implemented accentuate the amplitude and the increase of costs. The local authorities wonder about the organization and the level of the service provided to the citizens and seek to control their costs. So, the need is felt for a decision-making aid tool to find out the economic impact of each modification on the packaging waste management stream organization. The recognition of the multiplicity of variables has led us towards the techno-economic modelling of the stream. A preliminary technical modelling translates the intensity use of production factors (personnel, equipment). Economic modelling is based on the economic theory and the know-how of a major operator in solid waste management by using case-study data. The models are translated in a data-processing simulation tool. So, with this tool, the decision makers have a comparator to evaluate the economic consequences of their choices, either compared to their current situation, or to project itself in the medium term in order to modify their collection and sorting organization of packaging waste.	france
353	Management of peri-urban agricultural and natural areas in the Départment du Nord. The Département du Nord is heavily urbanised but there is also considerable agriculture on the outskirts of the urban area. The peri-urban environment poses many problems for farming but it is also an advantage for the development of these areas. Based on the example of the area round Lille, major guidelines can be drawn up for balanced management of these agricultural and natural peri-urban areas to the benefit of the two strongly interdependent environments.	agriculture;natural peri urban areas;urban environment
354	The management of holm and downy oak coppices in the garrigues of the Gard department: analysis of the environment and the productivity of the stands.. Medium term management of ageing Holm Oak (Quercus ilex L.) and Downy Oak (Quercus pubescens Willd.) coppices in the Gard requires a thorough understanding of the natural environments and yields of the plantations. This paper puts forward a method for analysing the environment and plantation in order to assess the yield of the oak coppices. 118 small stands were studied in different types of coppice. In general, two environmental parameters determined the dominant height of the stand: geopedological conditions (rock, parent material and soil) and topoclimate which depends on the position of the plantation (orientation and topography). The growth height is affected by the structure and composition of the plantation, together with the forestry and plant growth characteristics. Multivariate analyses enabled 9 types and sub-types of sites to be distinguished with particular environmental conditions (soil and topoclimate). The type of site is closely correlated to the variation in the dominant height of the plantations. Growth classes are proposed for the Holm Oak (3 classes) and the Downy Oak (4 classes). These results should assist plantation management selection: the best coppices should possibly be allowed to develop as standards, plantations of average fertility should be treated as simple coppices, coppices with low growth rate should be allowed to grow on.	environment
355	Management of Austrian pine on marly lands in the Southern Alps. Forest intervention priorities and silvicultural management. This article presents principles in order to aid to the extensive management of the ancient RTM reafforestations of Austrian Pines with the objective of protecting marly lands against erosion in the Southern Alps. From an analysis of the present state of these rehabilitated forest ecosystems, and with the use of the GIS ARC/INFO, it intends to propose a method to determinate places where a forest intervention is a priority, and to define a certain number of silvicultural rules to apply, in order to guarantee in the future a perenniality of the protection against erosion with a minimal management.	southern alps;erosion
356	The management of temperate herbaceous environments by mowing and grazing: How to rationalize the biological description of the flora?. The biological descriptors for grassland species found in the literature are detailed, together with their extreme states. The main combinations for the descriptor states are reviewed, illustrated by examples of type taxa in temperate climates (especially in the Armorican Massif). Grazing and mowing are compared using eight characteristics. The most appropriate descriptors (phenology including the growing seasons compared with possible rest periods, and the reproductive and germination periods; height of the plants...) are used to propose possible avenues for management plans. These concern the calendar for intervention, the selection of the harvesting exploitation system (cutting height and intervals between harvests), the type of harvesting exploitation (mowing or grazing).	grassland
357	The GEVAL evaluation grid - A method for evaluating the quality level of agricultural spreading of sewage sludge. Agricultural spreading is, currently, the main way municipal sewage sludge is eliminated in France. However, quality of the spreading operation remains very variable. Thus, we propose an evaluation chart of the quality of the spreading operation; this chart, named GEVAL, is built in order to standardize the quality assessment of agricultural spreading of municipal sewage sludge. This chart takes into account all the steps of the sludge production and agricultural utilisation process including storage. At each step the process quality is characterized by various criteria, which were selected to be simple enough to minimize the risk of subjectivity of the controller. These criteria are designed so that they can be adapted to the whole of sewage purification plants in a department or a region. Thus this evaluation chart should allow not only self evaluation of quality in one plant of a given area but also departmental or regional assessments. The present version of the chart cannot be regarded as final: it still has to be tested in France at a large scale, to improve its accuracy.	france;agricultural
358	Reading of river landscapes by a historian: compared valorization of running water in land development in France and in Japan - thoughts on urban aquosity. Today, the scientific knowledge of French water streams is still poor, especially in the way history is taken into account. The historian brings, by his science, an essential look at the landscape of water streams. Rivers are organically related to the country history; centuries have left their print, a print that the historian knows how to read and link to the habits and practices of the various societies which followed one another. The understanding of maps and registers, the search for old documents allow the historian to reconstitute the river historical socio-system and to help the landscape specialist in an essential way. By comparing characteristics of water stream arrangements in France and in Japan, this document offers a meaningful exercise which provides to the landscape specialist a good understanding of the landscape layout logics and reminds him of the symbolic and sacred meaning of running waters. The historian also brings cultural elements likely to favour a mixing of the various practices, and therefore helps enrich the landscape specialist's possibilities; similarly, the historian can, by downplaying the development models and the management modes, which have been transmitted to us, help the expert transcend history to go towards really innovating creations.	river;water;history;japan;france
359	"The diagnosis of the risk of pesticides transfer in superficial waters: the bases and the implementation of the method developed in Bretagne Region (France). The presence of pesticides in the rivers of the Bretagne Region (France) has been underlined at the beginning of the nineties by the CORPEP works. This pollution turned out to be persistent and likely to reach high levels, especially for a few herbicides used on field crops (atrazine and isoproturon). As the CORPEN developed a plot scale method to minimize the transfer risk of pesticides in water, the CORPEP finalized a specific method intended to the watersheds of the ""Bretagne Eau Pure"" program, but with the same purpose. The two methods, however, have the same scientific basis. The CORPEP method is specific to the region, in relation to its hydrological and geological characteristics, and the large area of its application. The construction of the CORPEP method and the factors selection are explained. The implementation of the diagnosis is described and a progress report of the method in Bretagne region is given."	pesticides;water
360	The IDEA method (farm sustainability indicators): an educational approach. The sustainability assessment of farm involves a great demand for indicators. The IDEA method, developed for an education aim on the instigation of the Ministry for agriculture and fisheries, helps farmers to progress on the way to sustainability. It includes an agri-ecological scale, a socio-territorial scale and an economic scale to assess, through 37 quantitative or qualitative indicators, the farm systems and to suggest ways for better sustainability.	agriculture;farmers
361	Implementation of Natura 2000 in private forests: an example in the northern part of France. Implementing the Habitats directive (Natura 2000) has raised in France an awareness for which private forest professional organisations played a major role. Two examples of Natura 2000 sites including private forests in the North of France (Oise river valley, a pilot site, and Lucheux forest) are discussed and show remaining difficulties: a major uncertainty associated to the double obligation of means and results imposed to the member states by the article 6 of the directive; the high costs of nature conservation actions, which will always be, at the end, a charge for the taxpayer; the temptation of the regulation way is never satisfying. It remains, for the future, an essential question that one should answer before going on with the implementation of the directive: how sustainable can a non-profit management be?	france
362	Setting up information systems dedicated to the quality and environmental management of agricultural production: a pilot operation applied to the field crop sector. The SIREME project lead by the research center Cemagref, aims to put in place information systems able to support environmental and quality processes at the production scale. This paper describes a pilot project: The conception of a shared geographic information system related to field crop productions contracts binding co-operatives and farmers. This system has to integrate spatial and historical management information, simplify data registration and management necessary for agricultural practices, and create communicating information systems linking farmers and their partners. Such an information system needs the use of new information and communication technologies, particularly web-enabled GIS. This system is currently under development, and should be tested during 2001.	agricultural;farmers
363	Setting up a water observatory: the case of the Bas-Rhin observatory. Water management stakeholders' demands are diversified. This paper deals with the question of the way to take these demands into account during the building of a new tool. We illustrate this by the example of the conception of a water observatory by the Conseil General du Bas-Rhin that we accompanied in this approach. This article presents: - the explanatory study we have made to identify stakeholders' needs. - Scenarios we have built up to take them into account. Finally, we conclude on the problems and questions raised by the consideration of users' expectations.	water;bas rhin observatory
364	The modelling of muddy debris flows - From laboratory validation to hazard zoning in the field . Mudflows are fast, transitory flows formed of a mixture of water and solids with widely varying particle sizes, which occur in certain wet conditions affecting the natural soil. When there is a sufficiently high clay content, the material is, from a macroscopic point of view, thixotropic. The transitory nature of these events required the development of specific numerical models in order to study and predict their behaviour. Two models based on shallow-water equations in conjunction with a special flow model were implemented to represent channelled flows and the spreading of material outside the main channel. These two models were validated in the laboratory by comparison with flows of model fluids (on a reduced scale). The paper then considers the practical application of these models in the field for zoning flood risks. Given the uncertainty of the extent of such events, a study based on flood scenarios was necessary. This approach called for the use of these two models in conjunction with various laboratory or field techniques, which were intended to provide better characterisation of the material liable to flow. This project also reveals directions for research to improve the performance of the tools proposed.	flood
365	European standardization for urban wastewater treatment. The preparation of European Standards concerning the wastewater engineering field is nearly finished and should end up at a rather complete series of standards. This paper proposes an analytical description of these European Standards (EN) and projects (pr EN) achieved or under processing in the field of urban wastewater treatment. The authors, directly involed in these standardization works give testimony in this european experiment. They explain how some progresses have been developped towards, by example, some forms of codes of practise only listing points to be considered during the design phase of projects or in other cases performance specifications with the relative methods for compliance testing, or rather numerous design specifications concerning safety in the wastewater treatment works, trilinguial vocabulary about wastewater, or at least the aeration tranfer efficiency measurement.	wastewater;efficiency;european
366	Is the standard ISO 14001 (environmental management systems) can be apply to farm ?. This paper studies the conditions of application of the standard ISO 14 001 (Environnemental Management Systems) in farms. It proposes some suggestions to make the application of Environnemental Management System in the agricultural world easier. These suggestions come from a study of texts of ISO 14001 and an attempt of transposition of some industrial and agricultural experiences. This study ends by appraisal of this work and gives some new tracks.	agricultural
367	The pathology of active avalanche defense structures. The safety brought up by supporting structures towards snow-avalanches has to remain total during all their life. An inquiry has shown that this was not always the case. A regular maintenance is therefore always indispensable. The main possible degradations are identified in their types (foundations, mechanics, physico - chemical) and their causes (internal or external, usual or unusual). It has been also necessary to formalize the different stages of a diagnosis process : the preparation, the evaluation and the classification of disorders, then the programming of maintenance. At last, financial aspects and the division of responsibilities of this maintenance also explain a large part of the failures observed. The role and the action of the user, of the owner, of the mayor and of the prefect are lightened. The will to prevent catastrophes must last long after the works are finished.	avalanche
368	Peri-urbanization or the emergence of new territories. Population and economic activities concentration is recognised as one of the main future tendance of space urbanization. It contributes to emerge new areas where rural - urban boundery becomes blurred. It settles periurbanization process. Therefore, the analyse has to focalize on mutual overlaps, from which raise situations of conflict on land management due to space fonctionnality changes. That naturally questions on the management levels involved, institutionnal (communal) and cooperative (intercommunal) ones.	population
369	The loss of water during air refrigeration of fruits and vegetables. The quality of fruit and vegetables depends partly on their appearance: the turgidity of the cells gives the appearance of freshness to the produce. Fruit and vegetables gradually lose water until they are completely shrivelled. The author describes and analyses the process of water loss during chilling and storage in order to give recommendations for improving the methods for keeping produce fresh.	water
370	"The role of treatment in the management of structural surplus of livestock manure. Poultry and pig farms produce livestock manure in excess of the crops nutrients requirements because most of the food is not produced by the farm but is bought outside. To restore the link between farm arable crops and livestock manure is therefore the great challenge to take up. Expansion of agriculture has led to livestock manure surplus in some areas (especially in Brittany) where this problem becomes regional. These regions are consequently qualified as ""structural surplus areas"" (""zone d'excédent structurel""). Processing of pig slurry is necessary in these regions as well as changes in feeding strategies, exportation of raw manure and optimization of land spreading. Currently, development of cattle production does not only deal with nitrate pollution but also can lead to more severe environmental damages. Ammonia emissions bring about air pollution and cannot be under control at the present time. A lower soil fertility can occur in case of increasing concentrations of heavy metals (copper and zinc). Also an excess of phosphorus can bring about water surface eutrophisation. All these phenomena are not well known but must be kept in mind as soon as a treatment plant is planned."	agriculture
371	French rural development policy: its relevancy in relation to changes and prospects for rural areas in France. In order to shed light on the relevancy of French rural policies and to project their adaptation to future changes, this article proposes four different scenarios, clearly contrasted and intentionally exaggerated, developed by the DATAR task force. These scenarios grant a central role to city/countryside relationships and their more or less diversified uses (housing, agro-industrial production, environmental protection, or diversified economic activities in a series of local family-based industries). In France, the orientation and the implementation of the new version of the second pillar of the Common Agricultural Policy are particularly focused on agricultural networks and issues. It is likely that this French policy will continue in the near future, but it is not sure that this situation can be sustained on the long-term, if its differences with the plausible development scenarios of rural territories are confirmed.	france;agricultural;areas

Causes that worsen the risk are also reviewed. A number of principles are worked out, like "" dynamic slowing down "", with which river management should always comply, in order to conciliate the various stakes involved. Other elements are provided which give way to a better management of this kind of hazards, throught implementation of a coherent management policy. Lastly, priority research subjects are proposed in order to progress."	flooding;river
373	Meat production and the space occupation after the BSE crisis: an attempt at foresight reflections. French beef is produced under different systems which vary in terms of the type of herd (dairy herds, suckling herds, etc.) and the socio-economic place that they occupy within the farms, the land and the regional context. The crisis caused by bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad cow disease) has prec-ipitated and amplified another impending crisis concerning the structure of the industry. However, it seems to have stimulated a demand for the production of grass-fed quality beef. This situation raises new questions and reveals complex interactions which may lead to profound changes in rural land usage across France. Against this background, this article contributes to the assessment of these risks by proposing forecasting principles and possible outcome scenarios. This work forms the basis of a discussion which could subsequently incorporate other variables and lead to strategies tailored to suit the different production systems and specific regional socio-economic features.	france;space occupation;meat;economic place
374	Reference natural models for waterstream planning. When the notion of « landscape » is taken into account in the framework of water stream planning, it must be inspired from natural models. Too many hydraulic developments have led to the channelization and the standardization of a great number of water streams. This standardization has led to a loss of habitat, a decrease in biodiversity and a drop in the biological and chemical qualities of water. In the framework of a water stream refitting, it is necessary to attempt to develop conditions allowing each species (plant or animal) to refind its place. It is appropriate to use and combine at best the root potentialities of plants in order to obtain results that can withstand heavy physical constraints. By playing with the right position of these plants, the water stream section and the design of these projects based on existing natural models, one can obtain a perfect landscape integration of these projects in their natural context.	water;natural
375	"The management of rural amenities in relation to the activities they support - the case of rural tourism. The management of territorial and environmental amenities involves a framework which associates public action, collective action and private coordination. Public action can take an "" indirect form "" including organisation of some interactions and support to some collective actions. Tourist actors are presumed to be favourable to the management of amenities, which are resources for them. The question is then to assess how they can be more involved in that management. The article presents the analytical framework of Research in Environmental Management (RGTE). It proposes a typology of the tourist actors in their diversity, and mentions their ambiguous relation to environment. The article presents three case studies which were realised in the french Massif Central. These cases suggest further hypotheses : the implication, sometimes individual but rarely collective and spontaneous, of specialised tourist actors in environmental management, the importance of actors qualified as "" mixed "" (who associate explicitly touristic and other objectives such as pedagogy...), the importance of public actors, in their evolutive context, the necessity of using appropriate tools in order to obtain the involvment a whole of actors. A need of further knowledge is to be stressed, about the linkage between some different logics, and about methods for the public and collective action."	amenities;environment
376	Restoration of the Cérou (Tarn region) image. The Cérou is a tributary of the Aveyron river, located North of the Tarn Department. The Segala Carmausin communities have expressed the wish to set up a river contract and to insure its viability by using a SAGE procedure for a Cérou watershed. The synthesis note presented in this document summarizes the Artline office's approach; It tried to highlight the landscape values to be taken into account in the future river rearrangements. The study classically started by an assessment that allowed to identify the landscape units related to the river. After discovering that the level of local appropriation of this landscape was very low, the team organized a prospective brainstorming with the various actors concerned by the river rearrangement, and got involved in the set up of the « Scheme of intervention on the Cérou ». The landscape study allowed to generate a local dynamics and a program of actions for the renovation of the Cérou image and for the assertion of a landscape identity of the river and of its related landscapes.	
377	Richness of the practices of rural tourism. The rural tourism seems to benefit from a positive image with the population, the media and the structures of local development. This image rhymes with values of nature, authenticity, soil, patrimony and inheritance. Polities, procedures exist to strengthen the touristic supply and its quality. This pressure for a best quality can be synonymous of standardization, leading to deny the variety, the variety of the actors, the territories as well as that of networks. Nevertheless, our communication underlines this profusion of practices of tourism in the farm ; this visible disorder allows the wealth of the initiatives and favors the specific productions; and all the objectives of the public polities would be to protect it.	population
378	Specific richness: a tool to take biodiversity into account in land management - Application in Haute Maurienne (Aussois, Savoie). Mountain landscapes worked for centuries by human activities, are endangered by agricultural abandonment (open areas become overgrown by shrub fallows or forests). Phytosociological surveys undertaken in Aussois, on 941 plots of 4 m2 each in mowed meadows and already abandoned areas (ancient mowed meadows, shrub fallows and forest edges), shows a global richness of 432 species. This paper proposes that richness should be considered as a five level concept use to compare different vegetation types or areas: species richness for a plot is the number of species per plot, local richness is the mean number of species per plot of 4 m2 for each vegetation type (mowed meadows have the highest local richness - 25 species per 4 m2), global richness is the number of different species found in at least one of the plots of a particular vegetation type (varying from 278 species in ancient mowed meadows to 232 species in forest edges), original richness is the number of species only found in one vegetation type (ancient mowed meadows have 40 original species, mowed meadows and fallows, 40), number of common species is the number of species found in all the four vegetation types (138 species). Abundance of Brachypodium pinnatum (a spreading herbaceous species) diminishes local richness and species diversity (calculated by Shannon Weaver index). It produces a quality modification of Aussois landscape which can decrease tourists attraction. Although, this initial approach could be re-evaluate according to other hierarchical levels (infraspecific, neighbouring sites, areas or regions, ...), it contributes on a conceptual and operationnal point of view to biodiversity knowledge to make the local actors of space management aware of the need to maintain biodiversity because it relates the visual perception of flora species richness and the objective assement made.	biodiversity;mountain;space;areas;endangered;species;agricultural
379	River seen by ecologists. Today, the scientific knowledge of French water streams is still poor. Research studies are usually focused on the Rhine-Rhône-Loire-Garonne, etc... rivers and, globally, medium size and rural water streams are not studied very much. This lack of knowledge is an handicap for a coherent approach that must prepare a development phase. This document gives the opinions of a scientist specialized in water streams, using the example of a complex fluvial landscape, related to the medium Rhône and located in an area of the valley whose fringes are still very populated. This part of the river looks like a mosaic of interconnected pieces, where transfers of water, nutrients and living organism occur, each playing a role in the functioning of the whole system. The hydrosystem is considered in the three spatial dimensions: upstream/downstream and downstream/upstream interconnections, transverse : lateral interconnections with annex environments and vertical : ground waters/underground waters inteconnections. In this document, the author demonstrates the functional solidarity of all the structures that make up a river landscape, and reminds that this hydrosystem represents a very reactive entity, from its source to its confluence. He invites us to be humble and reminds us that a water stream is an extraordinary piece of machinery whose devastating strength must never be underestimated.	river;water
380	Root stimulated nitrogen removal only a local effect or important for the water treatment ?. Plants in constructed wetlands serve as carriers for attached microbial growth. They mainly to some extent transfer oxygen and release exsudates to the root zone. In consequence of this an area around the roots, called rhizosphere exists, in which bacteria are stimulated by root growth. The goals were to ascertain whether stimulating the microbial cenosis only has a local effect on the rhizoplane, and to establish the importance of this stimulation for the water purification process in the root zone. Observations were carried out in a laboratory batch reactor filled with sand and planted with reeds (Phragmites australis). A small section was separated with gauze to avoid root growth outside this zone. The reactor was incubated with an artificial waste water containing a high concentration of ammonium. Samples were taken at intervals of 10 mm away from the gauze. The chemical and physical conditions and enzyme activities in soil sections at different distances from the roots affecting the efficiency of nitrogen removal were characterized. An influence was detectable by several parameters up to a specific root distance. Indirect parameters such as the total bacterial number and the DNA amount seem to be affected up to a distance of 50 mm from the root whereas the oxygen amount and DOC are unaffected at a distance exceeding 20-30 mm. This is an initial indication that improved nitrogen removal is also possible in the wider root surroundings. In view of the average root-to-root distance of 35 mm, the root-influenced area could therefore be expanded to the whole rooted zone in a constructed wetland. The influence on bacteria by roots is not just a local effect but may also play an important role in the whole purification process.	nitrogen;water
381	Remote sensing in forest fire forecasting. This paper presents a method for water stress monitoring and flammability of mediterranean forests using NOAA-AVHRR satellite thermal infrared (actual evapotranspiration LE) and synoptic meteorological data (potential evapotranspiration Lep). A stress index (1-LE/LEp) can be daily calculated. The results of this method, tested during Summer 1994, several large forested areas of the French mediterranean region, show that stress index completes current meteorological fire risk indexes. Furthermore, NOAA images provide a location of water stressed areas, where most of the fires broke out. This method should supply end-users with a tool to better adapt and locate their fire-prevention and fire-fighting organisation.	water;fire
382	On the territorialization of rural development policies: lessons from past experiences and perspectives. This article presents a major trend of rural development policies: their growing territorial character, coming together with an increasing involvement of local actors in conceiving and implementing development strategies. We discuss how the territorial approach can be really appropriate, especially for rural areas. Empirical results suggest that the quality of partnerships has a significant effect on the implementation of local development potentials. However, to be efficient, the territorialisation of development policies has to be implemented at a sufficiently long time scale. Finally, there is a real risk of increasing inequalities between and inside territories. The State has therefore still a role to play, even if this role has to be redefined.	rural areas

The Chaîne des Puys, a volcanic massif of the French Massif Central located at medium mountain level, is characterised by widespread spontaneous reforestation, often by a single species such as the Scots pine which has grown over abandoned agricultural and grazing land during the last four decades. An analysis of the flora in 106 plots allows differentiating four main categories depending whether the process is in its initial stages (moors or meadows) or its terminal stages (beech or oak-beech forests). Dendrometric data is presented for each of these types.	agricultural;natural woodlands;typology
384	The valorization of irrigation water through plant production in the large irrigation scheme of Doukkala.. Water resources in Morocco are potentially limited. Therefore, the agricultural sector, a high water consumer - up to 92% - should use irrigation water through a better technical, economical and social development of the water resource. Our work was integrated in the development policy of water irrigation by crops, in the perimeter of Doukkala between 1990/91 and 1999/2000. The survey concerned the main irrigated crops. The results showed that sprinkler irrigation only saves 13% of water ; therefore its use shoud be reviewed.The alfalfa is the crop that less uses irrigation water with only 1.37 DH of VP/m3. It should be substituted by other fodder crops such as the bersim. As the potatoe and tomato crops use better the irrigation water, they will be developed, mainly in areas where the water costs are very expensive. As grain maize is a high water demanding crop, its irrigation should be avoided when there is a water shortage.	water;irrigation water;water irrigation;irrigation;sprinkler irrigation
385	The hyporheic zone, a component not to be neglected in the survey and the restoration of rivers. Stream restoration projects are nowadays more and more numerous and ambitious. While they now integrate many components of hydrosystems, they are still ignoring a fundamental one, the hyporheic zone. This zone can be considered as a second river whose subsurface flow is invisible and whose functions are still poorly known. Nevertheless, the hyporheic zone plays a major role in sustaining stream ecological processes and preserving stream biodiversity. After pointing out how human activities can impair the hyporheic zone structure and function, we will show how restoration projects could be much improved by considering the hyporheic zone.	river
386	Precision farming. The modernization of agriculture has led to an increasing use of energy and amendments (fertilizer, crop protection products, water) that today need to be better managed in order to optimize their use and to restrict the risks for men and the environment. This problem has given birth to the accuracy farming, which is a new approach of agriculture, based on the integration of information and communication technologies and in which the medium (topography, soil, ground cover) is characterized by its whole spatial variability and not treated as an homogeneous medium. The production process may be locally monitored and optimized for each farming intervention : work on the soil, seeding, fertilization. Accuracy farming, born in the USA in the 80's, now appears in the main farming European countries, via the mapping of cereal production yield. This article summarizes the methods and tools related to accuracy farming: measurement of the medium variability, DGPS localization system, information management, decision making and, finally, modular application tools. Even though this trend seems irreversible, several hurdles still need to be handled, especially those related to agronomic and technological research, in order to ease the spreading of this concept throughout the agricultural world. In that respect, this article presents the work done by the Cemagref in the field of accuracy farming.	agriculture;fertilizer;locally

Peri-urban agriculture is subject to constraints, in particular those of land, imposed by the more or less near presence of cities. Treating it as a particular object rather than as a more or less modified form of the standard model is a matter of chosing which policies will be applied to it. This article has decided on approaching the adaptations due to the peri-urban context as triggering radical changes upon the systems in their functioning rationale. Two case studies, taken within the Mediterranean environment, illustrate our contention, trying to underline their sometimes paradoxical functioning. Insistence is given to the diversifying effect of the systems in this particular context as well as to the changes linked to land management."	agriculture;urban agriculture;urban
388	Periurban agriculture... an urban space for rural amenities?. The results presented below intend to show how, over the last decades, changes have occurred in how to take into consideration agricultural space when it comes to plan the urban development of periurban areas of the big French urban centres. The article demonstrates how such changes are part of a complex relation to space itself. Through the relation to agricultural space, what is at stake is a questioning of the functions of agriculture, which is conveyed by a contradictory demand for amenities. Such contradiction derives both from the confusion between the management of a lived-in space (landscape) and that of an ontological space (land use). It is expected that analysing this contradiction will improve the debate over how to make use of space around the big urban centres.	agriculture;periurban areas;urban
389	Planning, a tool for sustainable forest management follow-up. Forest planning was historically built around productive functions, in a tradition of authoritative protection, then technocratic optimisation. The relative decrease of the economical significance of productive functions leads forest managers to be more opened to land management issues, at the ecological, economical and social levels. More interactivity is then requested from forest planning : management plans can hardly be used themselves for a steady communication, but they may be a frame for it, organizing times and places where actors, users, scientists and managers could meet close to the terrain all the period along.

The assessment of Landscapes quality depends on subjective criteria, aesthetic ones in particular, which can be broken up in objective criteria. The method developed at Cemagref (Grenoble) was applied in the Loue valley in Franche-Comté. A landscape analysis, carried out at various scales, details visual components, dominance criteria, and surrounding ""atmosphere"" components. Those criteria, once integrated by the observer, help her/him to make her/his own mind. Resultats lead to proposals that will be then submitted to the local authorities before the final setting-up of an intermunicipality landscape management plan."	
391	Structure monitoring of earth dams: a necessity. To understand the long-term behaviour of a dam, it is essential to carefully interpret the measured data. Effective control of dam safety requires that measured data has to be interpreted as fast as possible after the readings. In regards to the methods of interpretation and analysis of such data, there are different practices and varying viewpoint. However, in every case, it is essential to have monitoring data. The basic principles of dam monitoring are exposed, as well as the objectives of the analysis of the measures. The value of such an analysis is illustrated on two examples operating two different methods. The first example concerns the piezometric levels of a homogeneous earthdam of 15,5 m of height (Chamboux dam, France). The method is based on a statistical analysis called Hydrostatic-Season-Time (or HST). The location of some indicators on the plans of the dam allows a global analysis of its behavior. The second example concerns a zoned earthdam of 33 m of height (Klimkowka dam, Poland). The method is based on an expertise of the measures. The object of this paper is not to describe the methods, but to convince the necessity of having monitoring data to estimate the safety of a dam.	earth

The 1,637 treatment plants located in the Seine river basin were first globally characterized thanks to a Multi Correspondence Analysis based on different parameters: type of process, size in p.e., actual loading, Suspended Solids, Oxydable Matter, nitrogen and phosphorus removal efficiencies. It appears that the actual loading rate does not significantly explain the variability of the efficiencies of removal whereas design capacities are non-linearly correlated to these latter. Based on this statistical description, several treatment plants were selected and their treated effluents investigated by means of 24 hours composite samples. Biodegradable dissolved and particulate organic carbon and Chemical Oxygen Demand were measured. The amount of biodegradable dissolved and particulate organic carbon remaining in treated waters ranged respectively from 1.5 mg/l to 6.8 mg/l and from 0.9 mg/l to 62.1 mg/l.	water;efficiencies;statistical;organic carbon;nitrogen
395	Sludge liming: blend quality and impact on mechanical properties. Liming is currently the most used way to stabilize sludge. To maintain a high level of efficiency, the blend must be as intimate as possible. In practice, however, there are a lot of heterogeneities such as lime agglomerate. Optimizing the process implies a better definition of blends and a deeper knowledge of mechanical properties. This paper intends to understand the evolution of rheological properties in relationship with lime concentration and storage time.	lime
396	"Composting separately collected waste: the Végéterre process. Stricter regulations have forced local authorities to organise home collections for biowastes comprising garden refuse, kitchen and sometimes paper, cardboard and nappies. The processing methods are not defined. In Niort, between May and June 1994, the ""végéterre"" compost method was tested on four different batches. One of the tests applied to biowastes from the selective collection in Niort. The other tests varied the composition of biowastes to be treated. Regular physical and chemical analyses monitored the stages of decomposition of the batches studied. The comparison of the batches was based on the analysis results obtained and on the regulations concerning fertilisers and culture media."	compost
397	The control of the conceded embankments on the Rhone and the Rhine The point of view of the Ministry of Industry. Within the context of the circular of 97/05/23 concerning the surveillance of medium-size dams, the Ministry of Industry (Drire and BETCGB) controls about 1,000 km embankments of 25 hydro-electric conceded schemes on the Rhone and the Rhine. In comparison with the high-size « 70-15 » embankments dams, these long-linear and lower embankments present a specific issue for the control: difficulties to set up a representative monitoring and an exhaustive surveillance, lack of data about structure of the works, maintenance of vegetation. The paper describes the means and methods set up by control offices and operators in order to guarantee a good surveillance standard compatible with the safety stakes of these long embankments.	
398	Control of geosynthetics in classified facilities. Controls of geosynthetics t in hazardous industry is particularly important due to the nature of the products or wastes which are stored. Laws which applied to the control of geosynthetics in chemical industries, landfills or agricultural effluents differ and so specific controls of geosynthetics display a various kind of prestations. After a short description of the French rules and laws concerning the geosynthetics and their installation, we describe internal and external controls and tests which are done and particularly in the specific domain of geomembrane whose first function is the tightness of the buildings. We also introduce the main control methods used at the successive stage of the project to verify the conformity of the construction with the regulations and the art rules.	
399	Operating sprayers: from diagnosis to compulsary checking. Before applying compulsory inspections of sprayers in used, the French Ministry of Agriculture need some preliminary studies. They have been conducted by Cemagref, during the years 2000 - 2002. The agricultural professional organizations have been questionned in order to summarize what have been done for sprayers voluntary inspections since 1980. Number of inspected sprayers, methodologies and organisations have been analysed. At the same time, the european situation is described to complete the overview of the subject. During the preparation a this new registration, the EN 13790 standard represented an important tool. It had to be fullfilled with the choice of the best adapted methods, the definition of strict acceptance limits for sprayers and the accuracy of measurments to be made. This have concluded this work, with the test of many equipments specially dedicated for sprayers inspections.	agricultural
400	"The public debate on natural disasters: the case of floods in the Alpes-Maritimes. Considering the obligations imposed by law, the issue here is to gauge how informing the public can contribute, in reality, to encouraging public and private powers to assume their responsibilities with regard to major natural risks. Whereas, until recently, a purely financial logic of compensation prevailed following a disaster, today more and more people are seeking to define real responsibility. This change shows the limits of accident compensation by the welfare state, which, based solely on collective solidarity, tended to remove responsibility from public agents as well as the inhabitants concerned. As a result, declarations of a ""state of natural disaster"" have been made more often but this has not lead to the introduction of correlative prevention measures equal to the objectives stated. The provisions of the Barnier Law, 2 February 1995, aimed to correct this situation in particular by encouraging mayors to be more proactive in the creation of PPR's (prevention plans for foreseeable natural risks). In this study, the question of responsibilities to be assumed by both public and private powers was considered in relation to flood risks. In order to test the coherence of the respective points of view existing within the public sphere, a double sociological investigation was carried out: 646 inhabitants of the Paillon valley, the river crosses nine municipalities (including Nice), were questioned in one-to-one interviews while 149 of the 163 mayors in the Alpes-Maritimes answered the same questions in writing."	natural disasters;accident compensation;floods
401	The water quality debate. How can data become indicators?. The water framework directive requires ecological assessments of water bodies in order to plan an efficient restoration. Up to now, few bioindicators have been used to sustain decision in water management. We try to analyse social reasons of interest or lack of interest for such indicators in decision making. We set about a historical survey of social evolution of several indicators. From this we draw different steps for indicator building and institutionalization. Such steps explain why information formats may be more or less acceptable for decision makers.	water
402	"Cultural development, between territorial marketing and recomposition of the social bond: the ""golden prison"" of the farmers of the South Dordogne?. This paper relates to the ambiguous dynamics of the social regulation generated by the standard valorisation of cultural resources in rural areas subject to both the importance of non-agricultural income sources and a profound social recomposition. The Grand Bergeracois, new territory located in the South Dordogne (France) is our case study. We assume that the cultural development reinforces the brand territories and gathers inhabitants and visitors for animations and festivities. But cultural development is also a normative process and thus contributes to the redefinition of farmers' professional identity and to the developing cultural heritage in the territories."	agricultural;rural areas;farmers
403	The european funds for rural development: a new financial framework for a renovated policy. The preparation of the rural development programme over the period 2007-2013 fits certainly in the continuity of preexistent rural policies, but is accompanied by several strong evolutions of the context: reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, creation of the FEADER and integration of ten new Member States in the European Union, legislative recognition of the new functions of the rural areas and reinforcement of decentralization in France. From the three objectives for the rural development fixed at the European level (competitiveness of agriculture and sylviculture, improvement of the environment, diversification of the rural activities), a wide conducted consultation at the national level allowed to lead to a shared strategic vision and to prepare the choices which will structure the future program. A strong territorialisation of the management, a concentration of the means on a tightened number of objectives and actions, a simplification and a harmonization of the details of the execution should contribute to the legibility and the effectiveness of the unit.	rural areas;france;european union;common agricultural
404	The future of the EAFRD: what implementing in the European territories ?. The 2nd pillar of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) will be renewed for the period 2007-2013. The implementing perspectives in the European territories are only partially known. But the first European, national and regional choices enlighten the evolution of some points. These were debated in Cork, Salzburg and assessments of the current 2nd pillar policies: budgetary perspectives of CAP, multisectorial aspects, subsidiarity and partnership, simplified, targeted, innovative and cohesive implementing. But the future of the 2nd pillar policy for 2007-2013 is particularly uncertain. Different scenarios are foreseen: the agrarian-based scenario, the reinforced competition between rural territories, the response to Cork and Salzburg wishes and the reinforcing of national and regional divergences.	
405	Bioengineering techniques for erosion control in rivers: age old techniques in constant progress. Soil bioengineering techniques against erosion are very old techniques. The principle of the techniques is to use biological, physiological and physical abilities of plants to get solutions against soil erosion. Soil bioengineering techniques can be applied to riverbanks but also for other kinds of slopes, for ecological restoration or to prevent from natural hazards (avalanche...). Soil bioengineering applied to riverbanks is ruled by a specific regulation. Mechanical resistance of these works is hard to define accurately, and increase with time. New researches are currently done about ecological characterization of species already used and other quite news. At least, we can quote the recent creation of the French association for soil bioengineering for erosion control (AGEBIO) that aims to federate parties involved.	bioengineering;soil bioengineering;ecological
406	The rural world facing the challenges of territory planning. This account is dedicated to the seminar conclusion « development in low-density rural areas » which took place on 29th April, 1998 at Clermont-Ferrand (Auvergne region). In basing itself on the community dynamics and within a standpoint of national territory planning, the various facets of the researcher and the intellectual function by comparison with the decision-maker are approached in showing how much it is important that researchers' findings lead to define new typologies, to set aside or to revise the ones which are in existence and to help the making of the transition from old ones to new ones. The functions of researcher's council, their expertise and their answers to social requirements are also brought forward to increase the efficiency of public decision-making and reduce the waiting period for its implementation. The organisation of relations between researchers and decision-makers is also an efficiency guarantee for the assessment of community programmes and the objectives specified for the reform of the community structural Funds, especially the objective 5b which is more particularly meant for the regions behind in development.	rural areas;researchers
407	No till in field crops and breeding: environmental and economic assessments using the direct margin and the Deltameq® and Indigo® indicators. To improve the knowledge on Conservation tillage, in 2001 a French Association for the Promotion of Sustainable Agriculture has lead a three years study in association with the Agricultural public economics department in Paris-Grignon of INRA. This study has been financed by the European LIFE project « Project 99/E/308 ». The methodology applied is an economical and environmental analysis of a panel of selected plots in both Traditional Tillage farms (TT = ploughing) and Conservation Tillage farms (CT) in several French agricultural areas. So, agri-ecological (Indigo® method from INRA) and economical indicators (Deltameq® software from Arvalis) are used to estimate the impact of cropping practices. The results of the survey are significant in two French areas (Indre-et-Loire, Côtes-d'Armor) and with several crops (wheat, soya and maize). It shows a great diversity in CT application. At the economical level, CT allows to maintain the yield levels (from - 8 q to + 5 q/ha), to reduce the machinery global costs (from 0,5 /q in Indre-et-Loire to 1,5 /q in Côtes-d'Armor) and the labour time (from 50 min. to 100 min./ha) and are not synonym of an increase of pesticide or weed-killers costs (from - 14 to + 15 /ha). It maintains also the direct margin levels in Indre-et-Loire, and improves it in Côtes-d'Armor. At the environmental level, CT gives a 65 % increase of the soil organic matter indicator by reduction of mineralization and also has a potential to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases: less fuel consumption (from - 18 to - 30 liters/ha) and weaker global energy expense.	agriculture
408	Flood protection dykes in France. National data base. The repetitive floods occurred in France during the last 10 years remind us the weakness of the flood protection dykes. In order to have a better idea about the state of such protection works in France, the French Minister of the Environment issued in 1999 a national inventory of river and sea dykes, of their owners and of the human activities existing in the protected areas. The Cemagref is in charge of the design and the management of the data base software used for collect the information about dykes. The present article outlines the objectives of the operation, the main characteristics of the database software, now accessible via Internet, the state of advancement of the inventory and the primary extrapolations that can be made at the scale of the whole metropolitan French territory.	france;flood
409	The landscape and the river contract. The landscape specialist is generally asked to correct the black points and to hide the ugliness. His task should not stop at the project design phase, but should allow him to monitor and advise during its implementation. It is his duty to use the opportunity created by a river contract to reformulate a coherent landscape demand and set up a global policy that would take into account landscape values in development plans. This article proposes two examples which illustrate the lack of global strategy during the setting up of the Gier river contract in the Loire Department.	
410	The Sorgue landscape plan in Vaucluse. The Sorgues network is at the heart of the Comtat region, which accounts for a population of about 500,000 and whose urban development keeps progressing. The decay of the plane trees that used to reinforce the banks and embankments of the Sorgues is felt by the inhabitants as a real landscape nightmare. After operations to bring in rocks, and upon the joint request of the « Syndicat des Sorgues » and of the DIREN, the Landscape Agency was led to reformulate and update the management of these sites. The landscape study started by an assessment and a diagnosis in order to highlight the wealth, potentialities, interest and fragility of this asset. The second part of the study is dedicated to the set up of a river project. This project, focused on the treatment of banks and of the riparian forest of the Sorgues, showed the extent to which the management of such a rich natural heritage must integrate all social and cultural, ecological, landscape and urban dimensions. It is now a complete strategy of land development and management which is initiated.	sorgues
411	Pollen, an indicator of wine production. The future harvest can be estimated using a reliable and reproducible technique for sampling and analysing the variation of grape pollen in the atmosphere. The results described come from a network of observation points throughout Europe. The pollen content in the atmosphere is a reliable indicator to predict the harvest after flowering. In France, this integrated method appears to be reliable, assuming there are no major post flowering problems. To generalise its use, it is necessary to quantify the effect of the post flowering conditions. The pollen emission curve shows the dates of the flowering period and can be used to judge (estimate) the qualitative potential of the year. This new tool is an effective aide to allow better control of the yields from the time the fruit sets and to achieve optimum fruit quality. It can also help the professional growers to manage the harvest period.	wine;fruit
412	Renewal of urban water distribution systems- An economic approach to optimization. Many approaches have been developed for analysing the deterioration of water distribution systems: these can be classified as reactive approaches and predictive approaches. The approaches have been modelled using descriptive statistical models or predictive probabilistic models. The Proportional Hazard Model, proposed by Cox in 1972, is a probabilistic predictive model which gives an accurate description of how water systems fail independently of the stresses to which the pipes are submitted. Economic studies have been carried out to fill out the model. The problem consists in determining the optimum time for replacement. This paper puts forward a new ageing model. A detailed study of the various costs was carried out and some of the costs were analysed. A feasibility study of this model on the basis of nine streets in the Urban Community of Strasbourg was made using technical data provided by the Paris Suburban Water Company.	water;urban water;statistical
413	"Role of passive protection played by forest vegetation against erosion and rockfalls. Forest vegetation can play a significant role of ""passive"" protection against certain natural hazards, i.e. that it can reduce the impact of a hazard after this hazard began. This type of vegetation action can be observed when erosion or rockfalls occur. Thus, it seems interesting to seek to quantify this protection role. Two research programs have then been initiated about these hazards. In both cases, real size experiments have been carried out and show, in qualitative and quantitative ways, the impact of vegetation barriers on sediments as well as rocks. First results show the possibility to determine management rules for problems of erosion and rockfalls by the mean of ecological engineering."	
414	Dissipation of pesticides by farm ditches. The intensification of agriculture leads to nonpoint source pollution and contamination of surface water by pesticides. In order to limit this kind of pollution, many research programs have been developed to study and explain the different ways of pesticide transfer from fields to rivers. For example, typical landscape environments, such as buffer zones, can intercept surface runoff. Furthermore, farm ditches seem to play an important role in the transfer of nonpoint source pollution (especially in the West of France). Indeed they can either accelerate pesticide transport as hydraulic accelerators or reduce it, according to their physico-chemical characteristics (length, flow, plants, organic matter, etc.). Since 1998, Cemagref and CEH (Centre for Ecology and Hydrology) have studied the retention of pesticides by several natural ditches. Two different sites were studied. The French one is located at the ITCF (Institut technique des céréales et des fourrages) experimental farm at La Jaillière (Western France). A water solution containing three herbicides (diflufenican, diuron and isoproturon) and potassium chloride, a substance tracer, was introduced in each ditch for about five minutes. Water samples were collected in the ditches at two distances from the injection point. The second study site is located at the Oxford University farm at Wytham. Water samples were collected on a weekly basis (routine sampling) and an event basis during high water flow. The analysis of the samples showed a reduction of the maximum concentration, compared with a tracer, and of the accumulative mass of pesticides with distance. We noted that the retention of pesticides was also linked to their own physical and chemical properties. The preliminary studies proved that the surface and time of contact between pollutants and substratum are likely to play a major role in pesticide retention.	pesticides;agriculture;water
415	The role of bocage in reducing interplot spread of crop weeds. This document considers how and when field edges can be part of the preventive measures against weeds. Four categories of the mechanical effects of hedge systems on crop weeds spreading between fields are analysed: windbreak, anti-erosion, restraint of agricultural machinery and as an obstacle to autochory. For 8 examples of weed, dispersal agents and the functions of hedge banks are compared in a table. The different functions are reviewed and a biological classification is made of the main weed species concerned, with emphasis on the possibility of curative treatment strategies with respect to the stock of diaspores and on seeking obstacles to the spread of recently introduced weed species. The optimal characteristics of hedge systems to obtain maximum effectiveness are discussed, and some suggestions for the management and design of hedge systems are thus made: height, width, the densities of the tree layer and lower layers of the hedge vegetation, edaphic properties of the hedge bank, spacing between hedges.	weeds;agricultural;crop weeds;hedge banks;hedges
416	Runoff on drained soils: identification of genesis mechanisms. Agricultural subsurface drainage increases the evacuation of infiltrated water and reduces surface runoff generated by soil profile saturation. However, other factors may contribute to surface runoff generation: e.g. limitation of drainage network capacity, soil surface sealing or compaction due to wheel tracks. The objective of this study is to identify the processes involved in the surface runoff occurrences observed on a tile drained field. Such knowledge aims at improving the efficiency of solutions implemented to control the surface runoff.This study is based on results from two experimental sites: La Jaillière (Loire-Atlantique, France) and l'Orgeval (Seine-et-Marne, France). Contrary to La Jaillière, l'Orgeval soils are prone to crusting.It is shown that artificial drainage decreases significantly surface runoff in winter: the ratio of surface runoff amount on rainfall amount is 70%-80% from a non drained field and 6-12% from a drained field. Nevertheless, the drainage influence is lower during intense rainfall events and events that don't occur during the drainage season (when the shallow water table is not established). For both experimental sites, the profile saturation at midpoint between two drains explains the main surface runoff occurrences during winter. A hydraulic diagnostic of a part of the Orgeval tile drainage network allows to specify the origin of the profile saturation: the network is under dimensioned (depth, diameter and distance between drain, diameter of collector...) or the rainfall exceeds the design rainfall event. Moreover, we observed that surface runoff events induced by high water table level leads to sedimentary crust, for the soils prone to crusting. Therefore, this limits infiltration capacity at the end of winter.	agricultural;water
417	The territory in the land management contract policy - A comparison of collective projects in the department Hérault. The implementation of LMC in the department Herault leads to the question of the importance of the notion of territory in this policy. Through an analysis of collective projects in terms of concrete action systems, LMC can be understood as a stake for syndical organisations and also as a result of local development history. We chose to classify each LMC project by its co-ordination structure, which includes economical and professional organisations, agricultural networks and associations. These structures are linked to different territories that can bear strong or less strong identities. However, this diversity currently seems to have limited impacts in the contracts, due to the definition of technical proposals at the regional level.	
418	The landscape theatre; an account from Spain. This account is based on a social and geographical study: « Landscape: resource for local and across-border development », ordered to the Forest Technological Centre of Catalonia with the backing of the European Union for the purpose of advising local councillors. This work has been conducted from a multidisciplinary and multi-scale standpoint. As in most development projects, the territory is considered a « scenario » that the acting people wish to share, but the decision-making process of the regional planning tends to develop as on a theatre play in which the actors look for a continuity and safeguarding of private interests. After a brief presentation of reference values, of acting people and of their situations with respective functions, a series of tools is proposed. One of these tools consists in using a landscape-measuring grid as a working instrument. The landscape-measuring grid is a hierarchically structured systemic model for information acquisition from the present landscape. It helps to provide the structure project with the required information to achieve the expected results. From a cartography of socially perceived landscape units, the landscape development plan is a document capable of including all the meaningful elements which are socially felt as belonging to a common identity and which can be enhanced in the future. This approach leads to the design of a development plan providing an organisational answer in order to succeed in meeting the priorities of economic development and planning.	
419	Aerobic biological treatment of grease from urban installations. In France, biological grease treatment is a rapidly expanding process, with some sixty plants recorded in 1998. Several sites have been studied and selected for their representativity. They are designed at a volumetric loading of 2.5 kg COD/m3 of reactor per day. Prior to detailed monitoring over a long period, pre-visits with summary measurements provided a certain amount of information on the operation of these reactors, the majority of which are not optimised (low yields) but have limited operational constraints given their low load. This study enabled an evaluation of the quantity actually creamed from the surface of the aerated grease separator in relation to the lipids collected within raw sewage, and an appreciation of the precautions to be taken with respect to sampling and analysis, before any interpretation. The recommendations prior to our measurements and the optimisation of the reactors made it possible to appreciate the considerable value of this process for the reduction of lipids and to highlight the main operational parameters in order to obtain high performance in combination with low operating constraints.	grease;france
420	The treatment of septic tank sludge: in a purification plant or in beds planted with reeds?. Taking in account the obligation of regulatory control of on-site wastewater treatment of dwelling houses, communities are now facing larger volumes of septage whose treatment should be studied and assured. In this context, Cemagref undertook studies to better characterize this septage and optimize its treatment upstream of wastewater treatment plants by activated sludge in extended aeration. We give the key factors and opportunities offered by an aerated and mixed storage capacity that minimize the impact of the significant pollution load of septage. Its dehydration on sludge drying beds planted with reeds without addition of flocculation agents is also discussed, and we then present another technique of pretreatment by stirring septage and mixed liquor which significantly improves the quality of percolates as shown by the first results obtained from pilot experiments not yet fed with the planned loads.	sludge;liquor
421	The transfer diffuse phosphorus in agricultural watersheds: orders of magnitude, mechanisms, control. Diffuse phosphorus emission from land surfaces includes a combination of forms (inorganic and organic, dissolved and particulate). The impact diffuse P inputs has on the eutrophication of surface waters depends on the biogeochemical properties and nature of the P transferred. A key property is the bioavailability of P, which indicates the proportion of P that is available for biological processes. Most of the P in ecosystems is associated with particles (particulate-P). Particulate-P often accounts for the major part of total phosphorus transferred from terrestrial sources, such as soils, to aquatic ecosystems. The movement of total phosphorus is primarily a surface phenomena closely tied to runoff and erosion and a discontinuous process, in motion during surface runoff events. The potential for this runoff begins with any process reducing the infiltration rate of the soil surface. Cultivated contribution to surface runoff vary spatially and temporally in relationship with their permeability, soil type, land use, and soil cover. Their contribution to P transfer and export vary in the same way but depend also on P content of soils, specially soil surface. Subsurface flow carries in general much less phosphorus due to fixation in the subsoil, except in some conditions including sandy soils, long-term over-fertilization, and agricultural drainage. Some element of the landscape are considered as buffers because they can filtrate and thus attenuate the P flux transferred to the hydrologic network (permanent vegetations e.g., grass strips, hedgerows, riparian vegetation). In the network, particulate forms of P can settle and dissolved P can sorb onto the network surfaces or be taken up by biota. In addition, major obstacles like wetlands can store and/or transform the phosphorus emitted from upstream fields. Thus a set of interacting processes move P through the landscape in a transfer system that includes emission from sources (mainly soils or sediments) and transport (including transformation and attenuation). This transfer system comprise a highly diverse and complex set of landscape structures arrayed in a complex and diverse hydrologic hierarchy and interacting with agricultural practices and management of the hydrologic network. This paper try to characterize the key phenomena and structures of the transfer system that condition the fluxes, storages, transfers and mass balances of phosphorus in agricultural watersheds. Strategies for controlling diffuse phosphorus pollution are also reviewed and discussed based on the experience gained in lake Léman area.	phosphorus;total phosphorus;diffuse phosphorus;agricultural
422	"The Val-de-Marne, the ""water departement"" - A global and forceful landscape policy at the department level. The integration of a landscape specialist in a department administration necessarily leads to a new set of relations between the various services and can allow an harmonization of all interventions and financing actions, in the framework of coherent operations. The example of the Val-de-Marne department is, in this respect, quite an illustration of that fact, since strong landscape wills and competences have led to the vote, by the department assembly, of a new 15-year river development plan, which represents an investment of about 500 million French francs. The department set up an interservices workshop at the valley level (the Seine) that allows to better understand the town planning problems and to integrate single operations into coherent programs, whose goal is to redefine the department river landscape and to work in depth on the use of plants."	water;department river
423	Aging of small embankment dams. The article presents the results of a survey on the aging of small earth dams. It is based on the visual inspection of almost a hundred dams in the Gers department. The goal of the emphasis put on the problems and on their causes is to better understand these works and to warn prime contractors about economies of structures, which do not justify all simplifications. The security of small dams on the long term can only be ensured if the options selected during construction are not too far from the options that have been tested for larger dams.

Forests can play a very significant role in the protection against natural hazards and risks in mountain lands, especially against erosion and rockfalls. This paper first assesses the knowledge concerning the forest ability to control natural hazards. Zoning aspects are then presented; based on a GIS use, they allow determining priorities for forest operations, with the view to set up a ""minimal management"" of mountain forest ecosystems. Finally, it is explained how the results of research are used for management and planning of the mountain ecosystems."	zoning;natural
425	Zoning, a controversial public action tool for the development of rural territories. Zoning has been an essential tool for most rural development policies over the past 50 years. However, its multiplication, the ambiguous climate in which it developed and the ravages of time have caused much criticism since the 1990's. Zoning critics particularly insist on the lack of coherence, on the boundary effects and the location advantages it creates, and on its ineffectiveness. However, substitution techniques that make it possible to select those who will benefit from public land development policies (individual identification of each beneficiary, selection of group projects, etc.) provide only partial and debatable solutions.It is hoped that this observation will encourage researchers and decision-makers to make an effort to improve this tool on new conceptual foundations.	zoning
426	Water without borders : an Interreg program takes the ecological and landscape restoration of the Lys valley (Nord-Pas-de-Calais) region in charge. The Lys valley rearrangement, in the sense of a landscape requalification and restoration, is a perfect example of a European « Interreg » action within the French and Belgian regional networks which, added together, make up the most important fluvial region in Europe. The Lys offers a large variability of flows, which means flooding risks, a water quality damaged by agricultural and industrial pollutions, eroded banks, because of the lack of upkeep, and obsolete equipments. The first realizations go towards a diversified use of the river, where the land valorization answers to the rearrangement of the river itself, helped by nautical equipment (yachting harbours, entertainment basis). The landscape rearrangements must help recreate the identity of this North region, while allowing a touristic and ecological redevelopment, and while also preserving an extraordinary network of ecological passages, in the sense given by landscape ecologists.	water;landscape;flooding
427	Sampling of fish diversity in estuaries: strategy and representativeness in the context of the European Water Framework Directive. The estuarine fish fauna is both diverse and heterogeneous. Its main ecological features make difficult the development of a monitoring program. A retrospective sampling of the trawling data collected by the Cemagref since 1994 allowed us to define the basis for a monitoring protocol of the estuarine fish species diversity consistent with the objectives of the new Water Framework Directive (WFD). A sampling effort between 20 and 30 trawl hauls twice a year, in autumn and spring, can be sufficient to correctly describe the species richness of the year. We recommend to adopt a strategy that would consist to sample 3 consecutives years every 3, 4 or 5 years.	fish;water;estuarine fish species
428	Household waste sampling. How can a representative sample of household waste be obtained? An experiment is being carried out in Niort on two types of dustbin. The green dustbin contains biodegradable waste and cardboard: the grey dustbin contains the rest. The differences between households are measured by taking 15 samples on the street. The accuracy of these results is calculated using a sample taken from a skip. The accuracy of the separation coefficient of the selective collection is evaluated using the BILCO computer program. A comparison of the standard deviations obtained by the two methods shows that the sampling per skip is much more accurate. Sampling on the street will be reserved for special cases where it is not possible to ensure that samples are preserved.	
429	A global view on econometrics of prevention in connection with the Inondabilité method. Vulnerability, as one of the two components of flood risk, at the level of each land-owner or -user in a flood-plain, is defined as an acceptable limit, expressed in terms of return period. In order to obtain a maximal fiability in vulnerability mapping and, then, in this of synthetic risk, this maximal risk has to be expressed in an objective way, from a global appreciation of his objectives, potentialities and restraints. From there, one can propose a methodology for making this limit explicit in relation with the submersion parameters, in order to apply it mainly to agricultural zones in a flood plain. Finally, other potentialities of economic evaluation for designing of preventive projects and for managing floodwaters are mentioned.	agricultural
430	The economics of the Brest bay area, impact of natural environment on employement: an attempt to quantify. The physical and biological characteristics of the bay of Brest have promoted the development of various specific economic activities, creating jobs and incomes for the people living around the bay and, further, in the whole travel-to-work area of Brest. The paper presents the methodologiy and the main results of a study intending to measure the economie importance of these activities, in terms of employment. Six sector investigations and an analysis of the results of the general population census have helped to build a global evaluation of the number of jobs related to the bay, at the beginning of the 90'. For cach activity, the evaluation takes into account the jobs generated, (1) by the activity itself, (2) by upstrcam and downstrcam activities and (3) by the expenditure of incomes earned in the two former kinds of jobs.	jobs;natural environment;population census
431	Geomembranes in Tenerife and La Palma Islands (Canary Islands). The Canaries Islands are situated, offshore from Morocco southern coast and close to the tropical line. The soil in each island is very permeable. It is then necessary to use artificial waterproofing to store water. Since 1983, in western islands, Tenerife and La Palma islands, 24 large reservoirs are built, and waterproofed with different kind of geomembranes, exposed to the sun. The paper presents the general approach from an economical and hydrologic point of view, shows some typical works and gives also some information on design for the anchoring against wind effect. And the paper present also the considerable experience about durability of geomembrane exposed to the sun in tropical conditions.	canary islands;water;la palma islands
432	The rooting of trees in embankment dikes: study of root systems and impacts on the structure reliability. As well as the crossing pipes or the burrows of rodents, the roots of trees are likely to generate erosions phenomena threatening earth dykes and dams integrity. After a short bibliographical review concerning devices and techniques available in woody roots plants studies, this paper presents the researches state of progress about the development of woody root systems in dikes. Methods employed and results obtained in terms of knowledge on the roots and risks associated with the presence of the underground part of the trees in the embankments are presented.	
433	Those involved in organising flood risk prevention. So far as flood risk prevention is concerned, the complexity of the organisation of those involved depends on the complexity of the type of flood risk involved. In addition to the fact that it is impossible to isolate the risk factors from the other factors connected with the use and value of water, the domains are interlaced and there are many and varied forms of unpredictability. The interactions between those involved in the problems associated with water and flooding are much wider than the official definition of responsibilities would indicate. In this field, there is a lack of precision in the division of responsibilities and the involvement of the people but the issue is even more confused when trying to establish the expectations and attitudes of those who are directly affected by the risks - those who live on the rivers banks and those who use the rivers - as is shown by the difficulties of making known the dangers and of enforcing the public right to know set out in the law of 22 July 1987.	water;flood;flood risk
434	"Farmers and the contractualization of environmental objectives: an analysis of the conditions for adhesion to ETCs in four sites. The aim of the study is to show how the farmers subscript to environmental goals, through the case of the ""territory farm contract"" (a french contractual tool to incite farmers to environment friend practices). The study deals with the farmer's reasons and motivations for which he chooses to sign or not to sign a contract, and to select environmental measures. The study also brings answers to the following questions : how is the contract integrated into the farmer's strategy ? To which changes does the contract leads concerning agricultural practices ? The work is based on a survey among both farmers who have signed a contract and others who have not signed a contract, in four sites (two sites in protected areas and two out of protected areas)."	agricultural;farmers;environment
435	"Amenities in rural areas; a stake for public policies, a stake for research. The French outdated word "" aménité "" recently appeared in policy debate, at the same time as several other vague concepts such as multifunctionality, sustainability.. An OECD working group has tried to make this concept more consistent, but its conclusions were dominated by economical views and development objectives. The authors show that these dimensions are obviously important but that amenities can support other stakes in rural areas. This notion leads to question the links between people towards a territory, and in particular, the quality of their relationships. Amenities can be one of the key points for a future contract between agriculture, forest and society. In terms of research amenities are arising a number of questions which can also be considered under the umbrella of other problematic such as sustainable development or multifunctionality. Nevertheless, amenities imply a specific viewpoint: the satisfaction of social needs is at start of the problematic which leads to cross spatial and social dimensions. At present, scientific works in this field are at the beginning. One of the main difficulties will be to address the question of ordinary places."	rural areas
436	Environmental amenities as results of the urban agglomeration process?. The environmental amenity concept, does not reach a consensual definition. So it is important to provide elements of reflexion, likely to define the studied object and to facilitate its management. Economic study of the land market, makes it possible to reveal the individual preferences for the landscape, from an implicit market correctly listed on the Bouches du Rhône region. So on the one hand, environmental amenities can be defined as collective goods, limited to the individuals enjoying them. On the other hand, this goods have a landscape-type vague carcater, not directly attached to a biotope or a particular landscape, but related to urbanization density. Consequently, the absence of institutional regulation appears under optimal and the most adapted management systems are those supporting a balance of the various specialized territories within the growing urban agglomérations.	
437	The needs of information at the regional level: experience from a manager. At the regional level, new duties are developing in association with the carrying out of a sustainable forest management policy. They will increase our needs of information in the field of forest management planning. Though they receive more and more informations, the key actors of the sector are facing difficulties of different natures associated to them, mainly because of the dispersal and the heterogeneity of sources, but also because of management and conservation of informations problems. On the other hand, statistics are lacking in such domains as forest roads, silvicultures practiced, management consulting and poplar transformation, as well as scientific references are missing e.g. about poplar silviculture and environment, management of unevenaged forest, and economical data on the value of forests. It is then important to develop the communication between producers and users of information in order to enhance the relevance of information for the forest planners' needs.	environment
438	Aquatic biofilms: to what extent do they allow us to understand the effect of pesticides on the functioning of watercourses? Example in a vineyard area. Biofilms are attached microbial assemblages on immersed substrates and play a major ecological role in stream ecosystems. Biofilms interact with dissolved substances and contaminants (such as pesticides), which can directly or indirectly affect their structure and functions. A variety of taxonomic and functional microbial indicators exist for considering biofilm as biological indicators of pollution (bioindicators). They can provide complementary information to normalized biological indices, which are used to assess the ecological status of waters, as defined by the European Water Framework Directive. Synthesizing results obtained in a river draining a vineyard area, we propose here to assess to what extent biofilms can be used to characterize pesticide effects on lotic ecosystems.	pesticides;waters;biofilms;aquatic biofilms
439	First assessment of the forest territory charters . The 39 Forest Territory Charters (CFT), started in 2001 and 2002, reflect, in their diversity, the diversity of the actors and of the contexts. A synthetic typology was established, according to two differentiation axes: the forest versus territory and the economical versus patrimonial point of view of the promoters. This first approach permits to evaluate a priori the strengths and weaknesses of a given project, so as to take them in account in its management, notably for the construction of a monitoring system. Later, the typology will help to perform the evaluation of the CFT tool itself, by connecting the results of CFTs with their specific contexts. Yet, during the starting phase, an in itinere evaluation, from the interviews of national or local actors, points out the diversity of actors strategies, and the ambiguities to solve : contractualization or concerted state planning, commitment of regions and counties as financers, long term financial support for participation management.	
440	The communities of macrophytes: typology, dynamic, production. The vegetation of hydrosystems has particularities in its micro-distribution (often discontinuous carpet, belts, pluri-stratification) depending on ecological factors. In rivers and streams, space and time dynamics are marked by the hydrological cycle which determines the variations of cover, and thus of production by macrophytes. Some figures of biomass and macrophytic production in river are given assessing their huge variability. A deterministic diagram of the distribution of the species and communities in the watercourses is drawn up. The phytosociological scheme of the main communities is pointed out.	
441	The conditions for the adoption of an innovative equipment solution: the tractor unit. Sharing machinery is becoming more common practice, in particular farmers are joining together to form small groups to purchase and use one or several tractors with their associated tools. This paper examines the conditions for adopting this formula for using equipment. It underlines the essential role of mutual assistance and dialogue between the farmers as well as the need for an organiser who is able to co-ordinate several farmers within one project. It confirms the importance of agro-economic factors for each farm. It also illustrates the contribution of agricultural machinery advisers who help farmers to make their decisions, in particular by supplying information. This work breaks new ground by taking into account the social aspects of co-operation to achieve a better understanding of sharing equipment.	adoption;agricultural
442	Biological impacts of pesticides in freshwater courses. The current knowledge about the biological impacts of pesticides in water courses is at first linked to assessment tools. They include single species bioassays, which provide most of the ecotoxicological data used in products registration, and more complex approaches, like micro or mesocosms and field studies. Among other uses, single species data are used in many industrialised countries for media quality criteria development. Then, simple comparisons of monitoring results with these criteria will allow to draw a first quality diagnosis, which is in fact similar to a rough risk estimate for the receiving ecosystem. More quantitative assessments are also possible at various geographic scales, by comparing bioassays results and monitored concentrations respective distributions. In this context, effect assessments solely relying on single species bioassays raise many methodological issues, including the relevance of exposure conditions in bioassays, as compared to those in rivers. Furthermore, pesticides are assessed separately, while the current situation in water courses involves mixtures, not only pesticides. Moreover, available effect assessment methods (i.e. bioassays and other tools) do not allow to describe several types of sublethal effects, which are potentially dangerous for ecosystem reliability. It is thus rather difficult to draw an exhaustive picture of biological impacts of pesticides in water courses. Methodological improvements are desirable in various domains, including exposure conditions (scenarios), toxicity mechanisms (also at low concentrations levels) and interactions between chemicals.	pesticides;water
443	French Farm Territorial Contracts: the economic efficiency questioned by the law. The Farm Territorial Contracts (FTC) crystallise the new relationships between the State, the farmers and the citizens. By the creation of the FTC, the French agricultural act of 1999 aims at integrating the environmental, economic and social policy objectives concerning the farm sector. This integration has been explicitly designed to improve efficiency and equity in the implementation of these policies. The implied requirements of the act, refer to two levels. The upper level is the extent to which the objectives of the act will be fulfilled. The lower level regards the reciprocal obligations of the State and the farmers. The economic assessment of the FTC should not be restricted to the lower level but should also include the upper level of high interest for the citizens.	efficiency;agricultural;economic
444	Approaches linked to quality produce rooted in native soil: account from Switzerland. This contribution brings a perspective regarding « produce rooting to native soil ». Approaching very briefly the notions of produce and native-soil quality, it addresses the subject from the point of view of market aggregation and liberalisation of the agricultural policy. The development under way in Switzerland is taken as a reference. Afterwards, the account raises some important questions still opened and leads to a suggestion aiming to intensify the promoting steps for quality produce rooted in their native soil from a European standpoint. This short summary is inspired by recent research conducted in Switzerland, and particularly at the Rural Economy Institute.	switzerland;agricultural
445	Agronomic determinants of runoff and soil erosion : from plot to watershed. We first review the processes controlling runoff and erosion and then examine the influence of agricultural practices on these phenomena on the scale of the agricultural field and the cultivated catchment. Agricultural practices determine the kind and density of plant and mulch cover in a given field. The cover protects the topsoil from rainfall and reduces the runoff speed. At the same time, agricultural practices are associated with a succession of mechanical actions on the soil that can cause fragmentation and compaction. These actions have opposite effects. Fragmentation increases the infiltration rate, but also the risk of erosion, while compaction increases the runoff rate, but reduces the risk of erosion. The agricultural practices used on each field determine the spatial distribution of areas able to produce runoff in a catchment area, and the areas susceptible to erosion. The relative position of an area along the runoff collector network determines the location and risk of erosion. This catchment hydrographic structure changes under the combined effects of climate and agricultural practices. Understanding the effects of agricultural practices on the catchment require the use of digital simulations with appropriate erosion models.	agricultural;erosion
446	Are fuse weirs so fusible ?. Discharge weirs are essential safety elements to avoid breaches by overtopping of the dykes, in case of a flood exceeding the reference event. Building an earth fill fuse over the weir is a tempting solution to increase the hydraulic efficiency of a spillway while limiting its length. Then the question is: will the fuse behave as expected ? This paper proposes a discussion about this kind of fuse equipment, based on the assessment of an old works and on the observation of two more recent during the December 2003 flood. Alternative solutions are described.	
447	Flow measurement devices in agricultural watersheds. Water quality research and monitoring works often involve nutrient flux measurements within agricultural watersheds. Flow rate measurements being essential for nutrient flux calculations, we propose an inventory and an analysis of flow measurement devices commonly used in hydrology. In the first part, we present the main techniques for flow measurements: use of weirs, use of stage-discharge curves and velocity-area methods in a calibrated section. An analysis of their use for different situations is given. Main stream gauging techniques are proposed as a reminder in the second part. Water velocity and elevation measurement devices commonly used are described in the following part. In conclusion, we recall the bases of data recording and the need for coherence between recording and measuring devices.	water
448	Territorial dynamics of agriculture and rural spaces in France. The comparison between two cantonal typologies, one agricultural and one rural, shows that there is no clear link between agricultural development and development of the countryside in terms of population and employment. Although some cantons have witnessed problems with agriculture and overall economic decline, agriculture has also undergone positive development in cantons where the rural fabric is in great difficulty. On the contrary, agriculture may become a more sensitive issue within the framework of rural peri-urban dynamics. This absence of convergence strengthens the legitimacy and the necessity of an adapted policy for more effective adequation between agricultural and rural development. 	agriculture;france;population
449	Alternatives resources to household drinking water: an inventory of the situation. Urban water has various substitutes that can be used by households to satisfy their water needs : grey water, groundwater (via tube wells), rain water or raw water (from surface water distributed via channels and a specific network). This paper, based on a literature review and on a French national survey conducted by the author in 2002, details theses alternative resources, presents the type of uses that they are able to satisfy and describes the main factors which explain their development. It then exposes their advantages and drawbacks, in terms of finance, environment and public wealth, taking into account different points of view: the household, the urban water manager and the whole community.	water;urban water
450	Run-off from a small Mediterranean watershed after a forest fire. This paper is intended to assess the impact of a forest fire on the flows through a small, 150 hectare basin. The changes in the flows are assessed by comparing observations and the results of various models relating the flow to the rainfall, that are presumed to represent the behaviour of the basin before the fire. This shows that the annual flow increased by about 15% with respect to the rainfall, mainly during flood periods. The peak flows can, however, vary to a much greater extent due to the combined effects of greatly increased production from the basin and reduction in transit time.	
451	Wine effluents: treatment issues and initial assessment of the design and functioning of the biological processes.. A wide range of processes is now applicable to the treatment of winery effluents and a specific methodology should be applied to choose the solution the most adapted according to the constraints (characteristics of effluents, quality required for treated waters, environment, storage capacity). The specificity of biological treatment applied to winery effluents is reminded as well as the possible performances. A wide development is given to the partial batch processes adapted to the small units of wine making, especially to the various systems associating aerated storage and various techniques of additional finishing treatment.	wine;applicable
452	Environmental and economic issues for a sustainable management of grasslands: points of view about implementation in France of the future EU Rural Development policy. From agronomists' and economists' points of view, this paper provides some comments on the implementation of the future EU Rural Development policy measures to improve environment and sustainability of agricultural land use. Advantages of extensive permanent meadows and rangelands towards environment and landscape are pointed out. But these ecosystems and the associated farming systems turn out to be weak. In this context, the payment of environmental services from extensive grassland management systems seems to be legitimate and to have priority over the support for conversion of intensive systems. This payment must take into account the global consistency of farming systems, either in local and participative approaches or in more general agro-environmental schemes.	france;agricultural;environment
453	Woodlands on the farm: A critical review of information sources. When some commune agricultural policy measures aim at encouraging agricultural land afforestation, it becomes useful to understand how farmers manage their forest and afforested land and what is the benefit these lands may procure to the farm system and more generally to the farm household. In front of the situations' diversity and the scope of the issue, a preliminary task is to identify the existing data concerning more particularly the French case. This article presents all the information sources available and gives details on the data they gather. This work points out the complementary analyses which could be carried on and the complementary knowledge which is necessary for a better understanding of the relation between the farmer and its forest.	agricultural
454	"Historical, cultural, economic and environmental factors in the delimitation of PGI zones. The objective is to identify criteria to be considered when identifying a geographical protection area for local agricultural products claiming a Protected geographical indication (PGI). This involved setting up a methodology, by integrating different approaches: historical, cultural, social, technical, economic, commercial, environmental, all based on products and sectors. In the European regulations, two major criteria emerge to define PGI : ""determined quality"" and ""reputation"". These criteria can be interpreted very broadly but do not deal thoroughly with the question of zoning. Therefore, six criteria likely to be involved in defining a PGI zone were identified: the origin of the raw material, ecological factors, local knowledge and know-how, the present and also the historical economic reality, the existence of previous zoning. Each criterion has a perimeter, whose limits need to be defined. Afterwards, the balanced combination of these criteria makes it possible to reach a final mapped proposition for zoning."	zoning
455	"Fermentables in household waste - Two separate management: the collection of fermentables and the individual compost bin. The aim of this paper is to evaluate two systems for managing compostable organic waste: separate collection by the municipality, and individual composting by means of a standard ""composter bin"". The studies were performed in Niort and in Rochefort-Sur-Mer (western France) covering respectively municipalily collected and private compost processing over the period 1996-1998. Users of the systems in both places were on a volunter basis. The study demonstrate that both system evaluated (central collection and individual composting) produce less residual domestic waste comparatively to the conventional system; although the organic waste fraction does not account for the overall difference obtain. The results indicate the percentage of ""kitchen"" and ""garden"" wastes within the contents of each individual bin analysed. In Niort, the monitoring of ""garden"" waste fate highligth the importance of dump including users for which central organic waste collection was applied by the municipality. However the voluntary system utilised in both places limits the scope for extrapolation."	compost;collected
456	Geomembranes. Since the first applications in the 1960s, geomembranes have become progressively more widely used for the protection of the environment. Some users and consultants are still not familiar with these apparently simple membranes. The aim of this paper is to make geomembranes more widely known, describing first of all the various types and their characteristics. Secondly, examples of applications are given and, a particular case of use for storing effluent from animal husbandry is described in greater detail. Finally, there is an outline of current projects for research, standardisation and certification. These projects, in which Cemagref is actively participating, are essential for understanding and accepting geomembranes.	environment
457	Functions, characteristics and dimensioning of geotextiles . Since their first application in the 60's, geotextiles have been employed in almost all civil engineering projects, to fulfil various functions. This paper aims at presenting geotextiles in a practical approach. It reminds all the possibilities that geotextiles give to designers, through the presentation of their six main functions. It deals with characteristics linked to these functions and describes some of the tests employed. At least, bases for designing projects with geotextiles are given.	
458	Hydro-ecoregions: a functional approach to the typology of rivers for the European Water Framework Directive. The implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive requires a previous typology of aquatic ecosystems based on geographical features. The proposed « Hydro-ecoregion » (HER) approach relies upon the ecosystem hierarchical control concept. Primary determinants of aquatic ecosystems functioning are geology, relief and climate. The cartography of these factors enables the delimitation of 22 first level HER in France. This regionalisation coupled with an ordination of the hydrographic network gives the template for the running waters typology. The concepts, methodology and the HER map are presented.	water;geology;aquatic ecosystems;france
459	The landfills, the sustainable development and the geosynthetics. The integrated waste management brings to consider a sanitary landfill as the last link of the treatment process. The increasing social sensitivity to the environmental impacts as well as the change of the National and European regulations induces a significant alteration of the storage concept. The bioreactor, digestor, bio-mechanical pre-treatment are concepts which are presented in this paper. Their knowledge is required to boost the application of geosynthetics in the field of waste disposal.	landfills;storage
460	Anthropogenic actions and their hydromorphologic impacts on streams. Several centuries of direct and indirect anthropogenic actions on streams have drive to a degradation of their ecological state, often intense, sometimes irreversible. Major anthropogenic actions driving to hydromorphological dysfunctions are described below, from the angle of their physical and biological impacts on streams. A second paper will deal with the concepts and principles of restoration adapted to these dysfunctions.	
461	Loire levees : from « turcies » to « Plan Loire » project, eight centuries of evolution. The first Loire levees were constructed in the 12th century along the Authion valley close to Saumur. Until the 19th century, the agriculture and navigation development required the extension of the dikes system. Devastating floods in 1846, 1856 and 1866 dramatized the need for improvements in flood control. Dike enlargement was not the only solution. To avoid breaches, nineteen overflow weirs were planned in 1867 along the river between Nevers and the Maine river confluence. Only seven were erected. 150 years later, despite the Villerest dam, adaptation and improvement of the Loire levee system is always topical.	floods;evolution;maine river;navigation;agriculture

463	Farmers' markets in a peri-urban context: how to estimate their importance? Case of the farmers' market in Aix-en-Provence (Bouches-du-Rhône). In a periurban context, the farms can take advantage of their situation to improve the commercial value of their productions by using commercial direct selling like markets. But the quantities of produces sold on the markets are not available and are difficult to estimate: they cannot be obtained by direct survey among farmers. This article presents the results of a study carried out in the Aix-en-Provence market and the methodology used to estimate the quantities of produces (vegetables) sold on this market. The market represents 75 places occupied especially by vegetable and fruit producing farmers. Several farmers and three productions (tomato, potato and salad) are selected after investigations among farmers directly on the markets. During several market times, sold quantities are estimated by counting crates at the opening and at the end of the market. Total quantity is calculated by two different methods of calculation and of extrapolation. The study shows that this methodology can be used to estimate the amount of vegetables sold on the market. This quantity is low in comparison with the departmental production: less than 1 % for tomato and salad and about 2 % for potato. However, these farms more often would not survive if the markets disappeared, and the markets contribute to their financial health.	farmers
464	Households and tap water: perceptions and practices in an urban community. Less and less French people drink usually tap water although regulations on its quality are more and more strong. This paper analyses this trend through a survey applied in 2001 to 219 persons living in a French urban area, located in North East of France (around Strasbourg). It tackles three main questions : what are the factors, which incite households to prefer bottle water ? How do households perceive tap water management ? What are the consequences of a punctual pollution problem on tap water consumption ?	water;france;french urban
465	Experience feedback of mitigations mesures and environmental accompaniing works about Port 2000. In 2001, different works to extend the harbour of Le Havre, Port 2000, have been initiated in the Seine estuary (France).This extension is located near one of the most important National Nature Reserve in France and concern one part of the EC protected area for the birds estuary and wetlands of the Basse Seine. The major consequence of these important works where to distroy the main high tide resting area for the limicols and other water birds. They also contribute to increase hydro-sedimentary impacts in the estuary in addition to draggings and reclamations done during the last century. To take in account these important environmental stakes, mitigations mesures and environmental accompaniing works have been initiated to reduce the impacts of Port 2000 project on habitats and species : the dredging of a channel 2800 m long, creation of a high tide resting zone for birds of 40 ha large, creation of an artificial island for birds. After six years of monitoring, results are showing what is running well and what mesures are not completely eficient and need modifications.	birds;wetlands;france;port 2000;water birds
466	The new challenges of sustainable and landscape management of mountain forests. After giving priority to intensification, our society now asks for a more qualitative growth. Mountain forest is directly concerned by this change of mentality, which challenges its managers by asking them to integrate ecological and perceptive dimensions to their management concerns. This new long lasting management must reinstall forest into its mountain context by respecting its specificities. It opens original perspectives in the field of upkeep of a minimal environment, of control of natural hazards by forests, of set up of a subnatural forest network and of reinforcement of its biodiversity. Finally, the article offers a number of simple principles for the landscape valorization of a mountain forest whose quality will be a decisive factor of local development. These principles do not challenge in any way the production and protection roles of the forest.	environment
467	Local agri-environmental operations in France - Conditions of development and evaluation. After a careful and late starting, local agri-environmental schemes have rapidly spread out in France. Different questions have been discussed during interviews with local experts in order to analyse the development and the implementation conditions of the French approved between 1990 and 1995 local schemes. This paper offers a synthesis of the replies to some questions: who has been associated with the development of the local scheme? Has a preliminary statement been carried out, in order to define the environmental stakes and to know precisely the local farming systems and their practices? How have been calculated the costs of farm practices in the contract specifications? Have local evaluation works been implemented? Further Cemagref has made a techno-economic assessment of the additional costs arising from recommended farm practices. All together works bring a contribution to the evaluation of agri-environmental measures.	france
468	Damaging flood prevention measures. For a long time there have been damaging flood prevention measures, mainly statutory. They appear to be little used or ineffective. One explanation is the lack of understanding of the events involved and lack of tools to be used in negotiations. This situation also obtains because preventive measures are applied in a very difficult socio-economic situation where land-ownership issues are involved. To make progress and resolve the current deadlock, it is important to use new models for analysing hydrological information and powerful hydraulic equipment to keep everyone continuously informed. New concepts are then derived which permit requirements to be expressed in various ways and to be treated objectively with regard to the flood hazards. They also enable all the interlocking considerations to be drawn together to help and support negotiations. These new approaches could make a qualitative step forward in prevention. Moreover, as they are linked structurally with flood volumes management, this would move flood damage prevention nearer to in tegrated continental water management, a goal for the future which is of considerable economic interest.	flood;water
469	The Loire landscape. At the level of a river, the landscape cannot be limited to a series of more or less particular sites to be protected. River is a data that must be considered in its globality. The « Conservatoire régional des rives de la loire et de ses affluents » is an association whose goal is to protect and valorize the landscape. We have selected to work on the areas that belong to the flooding zone and that seemed not only to be the most characteristic but that really had an identity that links human activities and the river life. Our work tries to understand the evolution of these landscapes and to organize the necessary awareness and information campaign. It deals with built as well as natural landscape. The Loire flooding area, in the Loire region, offers three main types of landscape which have been analyzed. Each of these three territories has then been studied, taking into account the notions of closed space and open space, the main perspectives as well as their functioning (soil occupation, biological wealth, existing poplar plantations and bocage). The Conservatoire has tasked an expert to study the project and to monitor the work by training the administration agents who are usually involved as well as the companies.	evolution
470	"Fish populations in lakes: typical assemblages and levels of eutrophication. Statistical analyses have been applied to the results of fish sampling operations on twenty French natural lakes (altitude < 1500 m); three fish assemblages were evidenced and placed inside the general evolution scheme of lakes. The oligo- and oligo-mésotrophic lakes can be characterized by Coregonids (inside a Coregonid ichtyo-region) or by the association of Alburnus alburnus - Gobio gobio, with the presence of Phoxinus phoxinus and Salmo trutta. Into mesotrophic lakes, the assemblage Esox lucius - Scardinius erythrophtalmus - Tinca tinca could be considered as typical, and is replaced by Stizostedion lucioperca - Gymnocephalus cernuus with large Cyprinids (Cyprinus carpio, Abramis brama) in eutrophic lakes. Because of the capacity of adaptation of the fish, these assemblages do not correspond narrowly to trophic quality indices but are indicators of the ""ichtyological condition"" of a lake, as requested by the European Water Frame Directive."	lakes;natural lakes;fish;fish populations
471	Opportunities for public access in private forests. Frequenting private forest is important and causes many problems to private owners: notably additional costs, degradation, civil liability and loss of enjoyment. A survey was implemented in Ile-de-France (Paris Region) about the opinion of owners regarding forest frequenting and the possibilities of opening their forest. A majority refuses a public opening. The paper investigates the situation and proposes solutions to manage frequenting. Juridical aspects are of great importance. Examples of opening and practical proposals are given, among which opening contracts between owners and local authorities, which could help in finding solutions adapted to each owner.	
472	Landscape professionnals at the service of river planning. COMEP (Confédération des métiers du paysage) is a French organization whose goal is to attune and coordinate the complementarity of the various trades of landscape: landscape designers, entreprenors and plant producers. This structure contributes to improve teaching and communication techniques. This coordination allows each and every one to find its place in an approach of project design, realization, and supply of the right plant material, while preventing dysfunctionings that may exist in the realization of any landscape action.	design;landscape designers
473	Collective projects in the frame of CTE implementation device: highlights from cases. The collective projects are a specific part of the implementation device of a multi-objective policy as CTE (french land management contract). Qualitative analysis of a sample of 63 collective projects shows the strong diversity of such projects, on the point of view together of the scope of suggested actions and aimed goals, of the internal organization of so built sets and, at least, of their way on which they are inserted in the farmers' relational nets. In the scope of a further evaluation of the CTE policy, the results obtained invite to give particular attention to these different characteristics and to the organization of the policy device at a regional scale within which the collective projects take place.	
474	"Small forest improvement projects in Limousin. The Regional Centre for Private Forest in Limousin conducted in 2000 an analysis of the experience of ""small forest improvement projects"", an initiative launched 11 years before. The study was conducted in the Plateau de Millevaches area and concerned private forests of an average 15 ha. It included the description of stands and operations done, as well as a meeting with the owner. Forest management appears to be a private matter, which takes time. Several types of relationship exist simultaneously between the forest and its owner, related respectively to patrimony, social concerns and nature awareness. The forthcoming ""regional framework for sylvicultural management"" will have to take into account all the expectations of forest owners. Finally, the promotion of sustainable forest management among forest owners will rely on local approaches."	
475	Private owners of natural woodlands of the forest: the case of the Chaîne des Puys. The current and future management of spontaneous reforested space depends first and foremost on the landowners. In order to know them better, a field study was conducted in a village of the Chaîne des Puys (a volcanic massif of the French Massif Central). After having identified the owners of spontaneously reforested areas by comparing the land register with a map of the vegetation, a fifth of them were interviewed. The questionnaire included a series of semi-open questions concerning the value of the land, the owner's management and his projects and a series of scenarios to determine his management strategy and the conditions under which he might support possible future projects. The private landowners inherited the forest extensions. Since they were not responsible for the current situation they did not wish to invest time or money to give value to a potential which they judged mediocre. They preferred to continue to maintain the plots which were already maintained.	space;natural
476	Association representatives and participatory water management: the case of the Orb watershed. In France, public participation in water management is increasingly institutionalised. Public participation principle aims at better water management but faces many difficulties in practice. Our working hypothesis is that the efficiency of a public participation institution is conditioned by agents perceptions and expectations. We define a frame to characterize agents just before they enter participation in order to understand potential tensions or stumbling blocks. This work relies on interviews with NGO representatives and on one observation of an advisory committee in the Orb valley. This study should be seen in the context of researches aiming at the development of concerted decision support tools.	water;france
477	Neural networks to predict fish biodiversity in  watercourse. Fish communities are closely dependent on the characteristics of the aquatic environnement in which they evolve. We have investigated the use of neural networks for modelling those complex non-linear relationships. This study is based on a large database of electric fishing carried out in the whole Seine basin. The basic problems raised by the use of neural network are twofold : on the one hand the network architecture is to be chosen by a trial-and-error procedure, and on the other hand the training and test sets are to be wisely chosen. The first experiments have been driven using eight empirical input parameters on 18 different species. The results show a reasonnably good accuracy in the prediction of presence or absence of fish. Further experiments are still requiered to confirm this results, but the latter already show interesting possibilities for environmental management.	fish;neural networks
478	Water reserves replacement: a solution to water stress?. The watercourses suffer in summer, and despite this, they have to meet ever-increasing needs: drinking water supply, irrigation, which calls into question the maintenance of their proper biological functioning. In this context, in order to rationalize irrigation and manage the resource as well as possible according to the needs of the various stakeholders, one of the solutions proposed to farmers is the construction of replacement reserves, which are supposed to fill up in winter and replace pumping from the water tables in summer. This article proposes to study the advantages and disadvantages of this solution based on two studies located in the Lot catchment area.	water;irrigation
479	Responsibilities in discussing the risk. Human responsibilities are being examined to an ever increasing extent in relation to disasters, even natural disasters. This is especially true where flooding is concerned. This paper examines the role of those involved in forecasting, preventing and aggravating disasters as well as in repairing damage, in the framework of legislation and regulations. An improvement for determining responsibilities and preventive measures is proposed : namely a discussion within the framework of the legislative procedures laid down for water management and hydrographic basin management.	
480	Techniques for the rehabilitation of ski areas. The growth of ski sports caused the creation of cumbersome infrastructures in mountain areas. In particular, the construction of ski-runs destroyed the plant and soil cover. It very soon became evident that, for ecological and economic reasons as well as to preverse the landscape, it was essential to reconstitute the plant cover as well as to take measures to control erosion. Since 1978 Cemagref has been carrying out research both on plant species and the reconstitution of the sub-strata in order to offer all developers effective replanting schemes. This research first considered varieties taken from those on the market. They were completely alien to the regions to be rehabilitated but were the only ones available. For the past few years, under pressure from the scientific community, fundamental research has been carried out to confirm the advantages of using better adapted indigenous varieties.	ski;ski sports;research
481	Automated processing of public contracts. Public contracts account for a significant volume of economic activity (amounting to 200 to 300 billion Francs per year). In France, these contracts are governed by a complex set of regulations, in particular by the Code on Government Procu-rement. The number of contracts (150,000 to 200,000 per year) and the diversity of related documents and procedures merit the development of special software. After analysing the special context of public contracts, the author of this dossier describes the features provided by the different software applications developed on behalf of departments of the Ministère de l'Equipement; these software applications are also used by various public and private bodies, local authorities, government departments and in particular by the DDAFs. A whole chapter is given over to covering the new opportunities presented by the development of electronic data interchange systems (EDI).	software;contracts;public contracts
482	"Three ecological approaches: fundamentalist, authoritarian or democratic ?. Ecological philosophies have in common the rejection of the ""economic ideology"", that is of the joint affirmation of the autonomy of economic activities and subjective rights enjoyed by the individuals-producers. This rejection, supported by the economic ideological crisis, opens up a whole gamut of theoretical stances, ranging from total rejection to the minimal rejection of the ideology in question. The awareness of the final character of the resources and the structural unemployment experienced over the past twenty years by the economies of industrialised countries, constitute the most important aspects of the economic ideology crisis. Three approaches are postulated - fundamentalist, authoritarian and democratic - based on the philosophies of several ecological leaders. The fundamentalist ecological approach is the most radical version. It rejects economic ideology, including individualism, in its entirety: nature is considered to have a value that is intrinsic, i.e. absolute, and thus independent of all attempts at assessment or human affirmation. The authoritarian approach puts forward a less radical rejection of economic ideology and in particular proposes the principle of responsibility (Hans Jonas). It is not a question of instituting rights of nature. However, our obligations with respect to future generations encompass duties to nature. We should renounce our liberal and democratic institutions and break away from technical utopias. The democratic approach is represented, among others, by the thinking of Ivan Illich and André Gorz who reject all form of expertocracy and remain committed to the idea of a society based on the rights of man. They reject, however, the independence of the cycle of economic activities with respect to nature and other aspects of society. The problem is to know whether we shall succeed, using the means available to democracies, with the support of public opinion that is aware of environmental problems, in reducing significantly the degradation that we are inflicting on the biosphere."	
483	The ecological status of water bodies; achievements... and questions: is the fish population a relevant indicator?. Numerous hydrobiologists and limnologists in Europe are mobilised for the application of the European Water Framework Directive (EWFD). It implies the definition of the condition of all aquatic ecosystems (rivers, lakes,~) and the assessment of their quality and functioning. For this purpose methodologies and finalised research works are needed. Interrogations are still remaining about the way to determine the reference condition of an ecosystem and to define the criteria to assess the ecological quality of its various biological components. As an example the case of the fish community illustrates the present knowledge and the questions. About the restoration of the lacustrine ecosystems which is the ultimate objective of the EWFD, positive returns of experience are acquired but methods will have to be transferable to any type of water body at an acceptable socio-economical cost. This latter aspect is by itself a challenge for managers and scientists.	water;fish;fish population
484	The piscicultural state of the natural lakes of low altitude. Characteristic species and stand evaluation criteria. The assessment of the fish community, as for the other biological indicators, is a prerequisite for the implementation of the European Water Framework Directive (EWFD). The eco-biological traits of life of the lacustrine fish species in combination with historical records and the literature validate results obtained from statistical analyses on a sample of French natural lakes (species abundance and water quality). In relation with the limnological characteristics, four fish assemblages have been identified, with their succession and relative position along an eutrophication gradient. Two assemblages with Salmonids are typical of stratified (deep) and well oxygenated lakes. An assemblage formed by the Pike, the Perch with the Rudd and the Tench is characteristic of both a more eutrophicated condition of the same lakes and shallow lakes with a belt of hydrophytes. The assemblage around the Pikeperch, with the Ruffe, the common Carp and the common Bream is formed by only two native species. Criteria are proposed to evaluate the quality of such fish assemblages. They need to be validated for their interest and ease of use. Thresholds have still to be defined (by expertise and inter-calibration) for the various grades of ecological status, as required for the implementation of the EWFD.	lakes;natural lakes;water;european water
485	Agroenvironmental policy assessment: a contribution to assess sustainable development policies ?. As sustainable development is a spreading concept, the need for the actors to develop their capacity to assess sustainable development policies in progress has become a mid term stake for the success of the concept. Yet this kind of policy assessment raises some methodological difficulties that could be overcome thanks to the experience carried out through agroenvironmental policy assessment. First, agroenvironmental measures could be regarded as a sustainable development policy, besides they have been assessed all over the french territory in 1997 and 2003. Therefore, the author uses the analysis of these assessments to set out how to deal with four major difficulties concerning the assessment of sustainable development policies : (1) definition of the assessment references, (2) structuring the different scales, (3) taking account of long term, (4) participation of the public.	
486	Economic evaluation of torrent hazards: uses and borderlines when applied to decision-making for preventive management. The objective of this empirical work was to contribute to define methodologic difficulties and possible uses of the economic evaluation carried out in order to help decision-making for torrent hazards preventive management. The cost-benefit analysis (CBA) has been the tool selected here and applied to a torrent watershed for various remedial measures against floods. We have pointed out the main sources of uncertainty impacting the CBA. They are a lot. As a consequence, at this stage, CBA should be considered as a decision-making tool, among the other one, and poorly reliable. A relevant use for it could be the comparative evaluation of some different protective devices. Somehow, it is important to show the results of any CBA clearly joined with the assumed hypothesis, the carried out simplifications, and the assessed uncertainties.	floods
487	"The evolution of logging practices could benefit ""biodiversity"": scientific reflexions on the ONF Guide for forest reconstruction following the storm.  A conservation based forest management implies the evolution of timber harvesting practices. The ONF Guide for forest reconstruction (2001) defines the harvesting scheme in windstorm areas disturbed in 1999. We explain why we think two of these guidelines, namely, the retention in cutting areas of large old trees and of unharvested tree crowns, could counteract the negative effects of large cuts on biodiversity - peculiarly on forest species. We finally discuss the potential applications of these guidelines in ordinary forest harvesting."	evolution;biodiversity
488	"Law, contract and partnership, the three terms for a new link between agriculture and society: the example of the farm territorial contracts. The reorientation of the agricultural policy set up in 1999 aims at recognising the multifunctionality of agriculture and promoting practices more favourable for the new demands of society. The public action engaged through the ""farm territorial contracts"" relies on regulation and incentive, as well as it gives priority to the involvement of a lot of stakeholders. Law, contract and partnership are combined, with positive effects on the link between agriculure and society. The first analysis which could be done of this complex and promising operation shows its interest but also its difficulties, its limits and the questions it raises. They can be fruitfull for those who need to reform forest management planning, and for those who will implement it."	agriculture
489	The French experiment of the PDRN : Evaluation and prospects?. Based on the main lessons from the evaluation of the National Rural Development Plan 2000-2006, this article aims, initially, at clarifying the explanatory mechanisms of the principal results of this evaluation in order to shed light on the future policies. While the most obvious effects are related to the income of the farmers, in particular in the disadvantaged zones, the environmental impact apparently remains modest. The dependence with the path remained relatively strong from professional and administrative actors, accentuated by the tensions between the sectoral logic of RDR and the systemic logic of the CTE. Although the structure by axis of the FEADER and the choice of partially programming at regional level (originated in the mid-term evaluation) constitute indeniable headways, it remains to check wether and how the desirable evolutions in terms of territorialisation of public action would concretize.	
490	Identity and cohesion as factors of local development: towards a better implementation of territorial policies. This article analyses the complex relationships between socio-cultural features, local governance efficiency and development. After having given a few general empirical results on this topic, we present four case studies on small contrasted rural regions. The results show that a high identity and local cohesion do not guarantee the activation of a development process. However, these features are a necessary condition for a strong capacity of collective action to emerge, which is itself a condition for a sustainable development. These results provide several insights for improving the implementation of territorial policies. They suggest indicators for characterizing the sociological state of a region, and define different priorities according to these features.	
491	Ecological engineering for erosion control in torrential catchments. This paper presents the scientific methodology followed at Cemagref Grenoble to assess the field of ecological engineering for erosion control in torrential catchments. Firstly, it explains how operational problems and issues led us to carry out investigations in the field of the interactions between vegetation and erosion, the efficiency of various actions for ecological restoration, and the ecology of the restored lands. Therefore, studies have been realised on the efficiency of natural vegetation barriers for sediment trapping, the mean to install them with bioengineering works, and the natural vegetation dynamics following their installation. Therefore strategies for the use of bioengineering for sustainable retention of sediment in torrential catchments are proposed, in order to reduce the solid load in rivers. The example of sedimentation control in the Durance catchment, in the French Southern Alps, is presented.	ecological engineering;efficiency
492	Public intervention on behalf of the natural areas patrimony: used instruments and state of implementation in metropolitan France. Facing with the complexity of the ecosystems, what contents can be given to the actions for the protection of the natural spaces patrimony ? This article makes the inventory of the various instruments aiming at protecting this patrimony in France, then analyzes the results of their implementation on the metropolitan territory. It shows that most of these instruments concern only a limited part of the territory, and that the range of the mobilized instruments varies strongly according to the region considered. It reveals a complex organization of the local action and invites to consider not only the specific action of each instrument, but also the emergence of a superior level of organization.	france;natural
493	Sludge reed bed facilities : operation and problems. Short operating periods and problems with dewatering efficiency, vegetation, mineralisation and odour are primarily caused by incorrect construction of the filter, poor capillary connections, an inadequate number of basins, insufficient basin area and overloading during commissioning and during subsequent operation. Dimensioning should be based on the sludge quality including the dewatering qualities and not solely on calculations of the sludge production. Loading after planting depends on the development level of the vegetation. The loading program should ensure that reed establishment is not impeded and should prevent the sludge residue from growing so quickly horizontally and vertically that the reeds cannot colonise the sludge residue. Overloading results in an anaerobic sludge residue with ensuing methane production. Typically, a sludge reed bed facility with a loading period of maximum 5 days, must be built with 10 basins to permit a rest phase of about 40 days. Facilities with 8 basins, where it is possible to load 1 basin for 7 days, will be able to have a 7-week rest phase before the first basin is loaded again. Facilities with for example 8-13 basins and loading period of between 4 and 10 days are able to achieve rest periods of up to 2 to 2½ months, which results in the optimal evapotranspiration and mineralization. The conditions and thus the possibilities vary depending upon the type of sludge.	sludge
494	"The ""Territorial Observatory"": a tool for territorial development. The Territorial Observatory was created in 2004. It reinforces the management of territorial development policies, in conjunction with other tools such as foresight and evaluation. In the context of European construction and decentralisation, it acts as a shared common reference; its analysis scales take this into account. A special website was opened in March 2005. A report on territorial dynamics and diversity is issued every three years and the first one was published at the end of 2005. It analyses rural areas in relation to urban ones, as well as in their diversity at the local level."	
495	LOIEAU : a software for the regional estimation of water resources - Application to the determination of reference flows in the French Mediterranean region. Initialized by the Corsica, Languedoc-Roussillon and Provence-Alpes-Côte-d'Azur DIREN, a thorough gathering of all available hydrometeorological data has been undertaken in the French Mediterranean region. The goal of this task is to acquire a better knowledge of reference flows (module and minimum monthly flow for a five-year frequency) everywhere in the hydrographic network of this region. A modelling approach of rain water runoffs, with a monthly step, has been selected. The GR2M model has proven to be very well adapted. Its accuracy is excellent for the module estimation. Even though the low water flows are estimated with some dispersion, the overall results remain very good. Moreover, the two model parameters describe accurately the rivers' hydrological status, which has allowed us to extend the results to the whole region. This methodology as well as the necessary databases have been included into the LOIEAU software. The fact that it has been developed under a WINDOW configuration makes it user-friendly. With the LOIEAU software, the DIREN now have a tool that allows them to not only estimate the reference flows, but also to tackle all problems related to the water supply and to its seasonal and interannual variability, everywhere in the hydrographic network of the French Mediterranean area.	water;software
496	Using coir fibre in protective structures for banks. For the past few years, natural coir-fibre or jute based geotextiles have been applied to embankment rehabilitation projects which use biological techniques - constituting a way to widen the field of application for such techniques. With this perspective in mind, we present two examples of the use of coir-fibre net for protecting embankments that are subjected to fluctuations in the water level of a lake (Lake Issarlès) and a river (the Rhone). Such techniques are environmentally safe and will probably become more widespread; with a minimum of maintenance, the stabilizing action of the vegetation thus established intensifies over time and contributes to protect and develop the site.	lake
497	Fight against non point pollution in rural areas - risk diagnosis approach in the Cétrais watershed. In the western part of France, the protection of surface waters has become of major concern for farmers and agricultural organisations. But most of the programs implemented for the restoration of water quality act at the farm level. In fact, a greater efficiency would be reached if the restoration programs could be reasoned both at field and watershed levels. To help managers to implement such programs, a research has been developped since 1997. The monitoring of farmers' practices and water quality on a small watershed (Cétrais watershed, 34 square kilometers) has allowed the building of a non point source pollution risk diagnosis, which will soon supply managers with references and methods for Don watershed, which is much larger (600 square kilometers). In this paper, we discuss the method of non point source pollution risk diagnosis which has been build on the smaller watershed. the method has been applied both on nitrogen and pesticides. The comparisons between these two diagnosis axis has shown great differences in the main pathways and risk eriods for the two molecules. For nitrogen pollution, the diagnosis has allowed the building of pollution risk indexes, more simple to use than models. Extrapolation to larger watersheds has been explored. For pesticides, particular indexes are proposed, but more work is still necessary to describe the importance of flows and retention in ditches.	agricultural;france;farmers;water;pesticides;rural areas;watershed
498	Water pipe maintenance: repairing or renewing?. In France, most of the renewal decision are taken with regard to the failure rate and in relation with road works. There is no long term planning. The paper presents an optimisation model helping the choice between renewing or repairing and incurring the risk of future failures. It provides the economically optimal renewal time for each pipe and the expected renewal budget on several years: it is the first step for working out a planning decision tool. In the evaluating of renewal and repairing costs (direct and social costs), the model RENCANA takes into account the pipe's failure evolution, the characteristics and the local environment of the pipe, the sensitivity of the consumers facing a water delivery interruption and the hydraulic position of the pipe. It is an approach which takes into account technical, social and economic elements.	water;france;maintenance
499	Control of the natural forest dynamics on old agricultural and grazing land in the mediterranean region. The control of forest extensions requires a sound knowledge of the plant dynamics which contributed to them. The management of these young forests is based on a diagnosis of the future population: quantity, regularity of the distribution and quality of the trees, the latter often being mediocre in the first generation. Several approaches are then possible from non-intervention to a complete cut prior to artificial reforesting over the whole area. All depends on the possibilities of the location, the importance of reforesting in that area, the existing financial resources, the wishes of the proprietors and, to a great extent, on the availability of forest control advisers.	agricultural;population;trees;natural
500	Land control and protection of a drinking water catchment area: lessons learned from an original experience. Land property ownership purchase becomes a solution worth studying to control the quality of the water of a drinking water collection area when the productive use of certain areas needs to be restricted. However such purchase projects may come up against a land market that is blocked by owners in a monopolistic position. Based on a real-life operation, this article sets out the nature of land problems in question and the characteristics of the technical system that enabled these problems to be resolved. In order to facilitate the extension of this mode of intervention to other drinking water collection areas, we propose that such land property ownership purchases be state-approved. This will in turn facilitate any future use of efficient land intervention tools.	water
501	Constructed wetlands for CSO treatment. An overview of practice and research in Germany. Vertical flow treatment wetlands have been developed as very useful tools for treatment of combined sewage overflow. Several systems have been in operation for over 15 years. Based on recent research work, new technical guidelines now recommend systems with a drained filter of sand 0/2 mm and a throttled outflow. COD, NH4-N and SS removal rates of 85-99 % can be expected from this type of filter. Too high SS loadings and very long or frequent inundation affect the performance adversely. Information for successful long term operation were derived from various existing plants.	wetlands;research
502	Threats on the Val-de-Saône landscape. In the absence of a landscape plan at the scale of the Val-de-Saône, the authors discuss their approach to set up a pre-diagnosis by being in a « watch » position in order to warn society about the threats on the Val-de-Saône and to generate a land reappropriation reflex. This approach shows the essential prevention role played by landscape specialists, who must first highlight the singularities and organization logics that lead to the landscape organization, and then encourage a landscape analysis that will be used in the framework of a global management strategy likely to multiply solidarities.	
503	Flow measurement using ultra sound Doppler flowmeters. Case of small rural watercourses. Measuring flow rates at the outlet of small rural catchments (<3500 Ha) is essential for estimating pollutant fluxes resulting from agricultural activities. Many norms exist for measuring flow rates(28 norms cited in ISO/TR8363: 1997). In this article, we propose a simple method for measuring flow rates in open channels using continuous wave Doppler flowmeters, henceforth rather commonly used. This method has not been registered as a norm, yet, but technical specifications have been drawn (ISO/TS 15769:2000(E)). We here propose a description of the Doppler method principles and limits. Several monitoring stations that we built serve for evaluating the performance of the method. We believe this method can be very appropriately used for flow rates under 10 m³/s and in locations where other classical methods are used in less that satisfactory situations.	agricultural
504	Flow measurement and suspended solids sampling on small watercourses. Two complementary methods for estimating Total Suspended Solids (TSS) fluxes in small rural watersheds have been tested. The first method consists in correlating automatically measured turbidity with TSS concentrations. TSS fluxes can then be calculated using flow and turbidity data recorded on short intervals of several minutes. Wide and sudden variations in flow rates and TSS concentrations can thus be taken into account for flux estimations. The second method uses an in-stream sediment sampler made out of plastic pipe and placed horizontally to filtrate part of the water column. It was left in place for two weeks time. Both methods were tested during a whole hydrological year at the outlet of two small (2.2 and 4.5 km²) rural watersheds in Normandy, France. Turbidity data require relatively long and meticulous processing to correct for long and short-term drifts, as well as for diurnal variations. The value of the method lies on the goodness of fit between turbidity values and TSS concentrations, particularly for large values. Indeed, these values, although relatively rare (<1% of the time), can account for more than 50% of the cumulated TSS fluxes over a year. Amounts of sediments collected by the in-stream samplers could be correlated with TSS fluxes estimated using the first method. Although this represents a rather crude method, these samplers could be installed, after calibration, at several locations within watersheds for flux estimations in addition to information provided on the TSS composition. The two methods seem to be an interesting approach for studying TSS fluxes in small rural watersheds for which obtaining detailed information on spatial and temporal scales remains a true issue.	water
505	"Measurements of suspended load in the Durance river over 150 years (1857-2007): links with the operations of ecological restoration at the scale of the catchment and the river. The aim of this paper is to make a review of suspended sediment load in the Durance river for 150 years, trying to relate evolutions to changes in the basin and in hydroclimatology. This work illustrates the difficulty of isolating the factors of each others because the feedback loops between processes are numerous. Essential for erosion, forest cover, for example, has been significantly increased to approximately 40 % of the basin today. Before 1948, this increase is mainly due to reforestation of eroded mountains (260 000 ha). After that date, the processes of natural recolonization of degraded land is fundamental. On marly small experimental basins near Digne, in the Bleone sub-basin, we now measure specific annual production of sediments 220 times less important in a catchment with a vegetation coverage of 87 % that a catchment with a vegetation coverage of 32 %. To analyze the data during more than a century, it is also necessary to understand the ""relationship to the object of study"" that scientists from different periods have because their motivations directly affect the datas and papers that they leave to us. This should make us think on those we will leave to future generations."	durance river
506	Physical measures of soil variability in precision agriculture. Soil is generally considered to have a major effect on crop yield and may be subjected to spatial and temporal variability. This paper introduces different methods involved in soil characterization in the field of precision agriculture. Quantitative methods based on soil sampling give information about physical and chemical composition of soils. On the other hand, qualitative methods of soil characterization give complementary information by using electrical resistivity measurements, reflectivity or mechanical measurements. These last methods allow to reduce soil sampling density.	agriculture
507	Evaluation method of the IRRIPARC irrigation consulting action in Nord-Pas-de-Calais and Picardie regions. Several technical support actions in irrigation have been carried out in France. However, very few have been evaluated to determine their actual impact on irrigation practices and their water saving benefits. In this paper, an assessment method of a technical support action is presented on a concrete case: the IRRIPARC action. The action was carried in the Nord Pas-de-Calais region of France. It aims at providing to farmers technical forms to help them to set their irrigation guns according to the wind speed in order to improve water distribution uniformity. The method depends on three criteria based on the effectiveness, the relevance and the consistency of the action. The data have been collected through quantitative and qualitative enquiries to different stakeholders: farmers to which the action was intended, and other partners which were involved in the action. The analysis results in evolution perspective of IRRIPARC action.	irrigation;water;france

In the Aquae research program, a project examines the effects of watershed management systems on particles and dissolved element transfers, and on water quality in a breeding area. We looked for the explanations about the particle growth emissions and transfers toward two small streams which are tributaries of the Oir. Little by little, ploughland is spreading at the expense of grassland, the ""Bocage"" landscape structure is disappearing : consequently, soil erosion phenomena are becoming harsher and riverbank fragility is increasing. We have first processed the different informations from ground and cartography with a GIS. Afterwards, we have analysed the sensitivity of zones to particle transfers by carrying out a multi-criteria evaluation with the ELECTRE method."	research;watershed
509	Inventory methods and mapping of forest extensions. A better knowledge of forest extensions is becoming more and more urgent whether for economical, environmental or social reasons. This is shown by a demand for information, notably in the form of maps. We propose to look over the data and the processing methods available for listing and mapping spontaneous forest extensions. The dynamics of the vegetation related to the natural reforestation of abandoned agricultural land often comprises an intermediate phase corresponding to the invasion by low ligneous vegetation of the species originally cultivated. A first study performed in Cantal shows that the various classes of fallow land are generally too variable and show too much radiometric confusion to allow reliable identification using Spot satellite images taken at any given moment. However a diachronic approach by comparison of images allows identifying the areas which show radiometric changes and then characterise the changes. As for aerial photography, it seems the most suitable medium and its stereoscopic analysis is the best method for identifying the phenomena. However, the digital processing of photographs is fast developing. A second example presents the results obtained by Swiss software automatically classifying digitised aerial photographs in forest formations from isolated trees to closed forest. This type of application, made possible by recent progress in data processing, should develop further. It should be favoured by the development of the market for digital aerial photographs as well as by the arrival on the market in 1999 of new satellite data with a resolution of 1 or 2 m.	agricultural
510	Detecting method of the type of submerged materials and scouring. An assessment of the detection methods of immersed materials was carried out by the CNR Test Control Measurement laboratory from 2000 to 2003 The preliminary feasibility study has shown that the side-scan sonar was the most effective detection method. Therefore an extended survey has been undertaken using this technology, on specific and linear sample works, in collaboration with IOTA Company, specialized in acoustic detection. The advantages of this type of investigation concern the detection of scouring of works with diffi cult access, for its high effectiveness on linear works, and for the material characterization of the embankments protection and of the river bed.

512	Farm diagnosis methods and indicators: overview and special cases applied to the evaluation of phytosanitary practices. Since the later eighties, the taking into account of environmental preservation in farming has made necessary the use of environment tools and ways of assessing farming systems. Farm assessment diagnosis based on indicators are one of the answers to the issue. In this perspective way, 17 methods taking into account the environment issue reduced to a farm scale have been registered and compared. All those methods are based on indicators and are presented according to the elements analysed (environmental, economic and social issues). A second part of this research is directly oriented to develop assessment methods who target environmental impact of pesticides. 17 other and more specific methods based on pesticide indicators have been identified, analysed and compared; this analysis being based on bibliographical survey.	environment;pesticide;research
513	In-filed dynamic methods for soil physical characterization. The main objective of the presented researches is to develop in-field dynamic methods for soil characterization. Two technologies are developed: the first one is an electromagnetic method, based on the use of a microwave radar; the second one is mechanical, with the measurement of the soil mechanical resistance (steel blades plough the soil at different working depths). These sensors are implemented on mobile engines. Combined with a global positioning system (GPS), they allow to create in-field maps of soil's heterogeneities.	
514	Methods and tools for the spatial analysis of fish habitats in anthropized river contexts. Effective management and restoration of habitat for fish should consider how the different vital habitats need to be arranged spatially and their connectivity, especially in human-impacted rivers. As few operational methods are available to study these issues, we propose a riverscape approach based on landscape ecology and stream ecology concepts. It uses a GIS-based habitat mapping and methods and software tools, adapted to the running water characteristics, to make the spatial analysis of fish habitats patterns. These methods allow the detection of the effects of physical alteration and flow regulation on the spatial structure of fish habitats. An illustration is made with the common barbel (Barbus barbus), a threatened species in human-impacted European rivers.	fish
515	Analysis methodology and modeling of a shared Spatial Reference Information System: SIREME. SIREME project, lead by the research center Cemagref, aims to put in place geographic information systems able to support environmental and quality processes at the production scale. This paper describes the methodology used for GIS analysis and modeling and its testing on a pilot project. This methodology is based on systemic analysis and on the implementation of an analytical process of information systems. Classical method and modeling tools (MERISE) have been used, improved by object-oriented approach like: · An approach reinforcing preliminary studies and employing prototypes. · Use of object-oriented tools as UML: inheritance relations, use cases, specialized design case tool for spatial database. · Metadata definition able to support generic models and future evolutions of the system. An important point of the approach is to integrate modeling data standards in the purpose to develop EDI (Electronic Data Interchange) between information systems used in agriculture. An example will support the presentation: The conceptual modeling of a shared geographic information system related to field crop productions under environmental and quality management system (AgriconfianceÒ) binding co-operatives and farmers.	research;lead;geographic

Nevertheless this pluridisciplinary approach may be applied to all kinds of dykes for flood protection whose main characteristics are their small height, great length, old age and rare operation. The successive steps of the diagnosis are described: history, morphodynamics, hydrology and hydraulics, visual inspection, geophysical and geotechnical investigations, modelling, risk analysis.	flood;flood control
517	Wastewater treatment plants for small communities: a methodology for estimation investment and operating costs. Due to recent laws and regulations in France, small communities will have to increase their investment rate in waste water treatment plants in the coming years. However, for an objective analysis and comparison of available solutions, and beyond technical arguments, public contractors generally miss economical evaluations. We propose a method for getting references. As for investment costs, treatment chains are split into functional units, and each of them is estimated from a sample of building contracts. Investment costs are then recomposed for different processes, at different capacities. For estimating the operating costs, standard operating tasks are defined, and their cost reconstructed from energy and personnel elementary costs. This method is applied to eleven treatment processes.	water;wastewater
518	"Methodology for an automated farm tractor advancement system. Within the framework of the Mecafutur programme, a Cemagref team is working on an information system for agricultural tractors. This computer displays information and advice to the driver for an optimization of the tractor-implement system. The goal is to improve the tractor use by the means of a friendly and efficient man-machine interface, that can help the driver to find best adjustements. The point developed here is the optimization of the engine resources, by the display of the most appropriated gear box and engine speed positions for the forgoing work. This paper deals with reasonings connecting engine power and driving comfort, as a new representation of the state of the functionning engine on the dashboard. These reasonings are also usable for the establishments of driving rules for a future system of automatic travelling of the tractor, as the ""cruise control"" system, already experimented for the speed maintenance on cars."	agricultural
519	"Development of an automated system for measuring the biodegradability of materials. The use of agricultural plastics has been booming for the last 50 years, and the consumption has been multiplied by 600 times between 1956 and 1995. Unfortunately, facing this development, neither an efficient disposal organisation, nor a recycling one have been set up. Consequently, farmers cannot eliminate agricultural plastic wastes efficiently. A solution should be the use of biodegradable plastics. An important set of such materials is now available on the market, and it becomes necessary to assess their biodegradability. The biodegradability measurement methods are complex, manpower and time consuming, and therefore expansive. The objective of this work is the setting up of an automatic device for the biodegradability assessment of natural or synthetic biopolymers. This system will comply with the future CEN standard prEN 13432 "" requirement for packaging recoverable through composting and biodegradation, test scheme and evaluation criteria for the final acceptance of packaging "". The device is based on the Sturm method and consists in a set of 9 glass reactors where materials are immersed in water in the presence of bacteria. The result of the biodegradation is production of CO2 which rate is periodically analysed by an IR gas analyser. The automation concerns the logging and the analysis of the CO2 in each reactor, the calibration, the data storage and its processing. In order to make this system automatic, the amount of CO2 produced during the biodegradation is periodically analysed by the gas analyser piloted by a computer. The computer also acquires and processes the data. The work described below consists mainly in the establishment of the device specification booklet, and a comparison between manual and automatic measurement methods. A last objective of this work is to let this system for a public use (analysis for consumer organisation, for technical centres, and other bodies)."	agricultural;water;recycling;plastics;farmers
520	Valuing rural territory specific attributes: the case of environmental amenities in the European context. The question of how to assess demand for environmental goods and services has been for several years one of the principal subject in environmental economics. Multifonctionnality of land activity replaces social demand assessments for various rural amenities as an important input to debate for the ongoing work on instruments of public intervention as agri-environmental policies. In this article, we present applications of conventional methods based on individual preference to estimate rural amenities values in Europe. Conventional methods face several problems and fail to assess the multifonctionnality of agricultural policy. We then argue the need for future researches to focus on methodologies that describe differences in public preferences and address non-marketed multiple outputs from agriculture assessment in a general form.	
521	Farming territorial contracts and the water issue in the departement of Dordogne: a territorial diagnosis. A territorial diagnosis of the departement of Dordogne is being carried out in order to help implementing farmers territorial contracts (FTC). This diagnosis will serve as a framework for the contracts adapted to local problems as well as an inventory of fixtures for a future assessment of this procedure. The final aim is to set up an appropriate zoning of the department with respect to the environmental situation as described by 'indicators'. The two studied issues concern the quantitative management of surface waters impaired by natural drying out and irrigation and the pollution of raw drinking water by agricultural originated nitrate.	water;agricultural;irrigation;zoning

This paper outlines the results of 4 years of research (French National Project CRITERRE) dealing with geophysical and geotechnical high output methods used for the diagnosis of flood protection dikes. The diagnosis of these embankments structures is difficult because there are very long and are not saturated under the service conditions. These results have been obtained from experimental measurement conducted in various contexts. A practical methodology is proposed and the suggested geophysical methods are presented.	geophysical;flood

Since 1998, the experimental watershed of ""Fontaine du Theil"" enabled to put into practice the CORPEN (Comité d'orientation pour des pratiques agricoles respectueuses de l'environnement) advice the aims which were to control both limited and diffuse pollutions of the environment. The objective of the project planned for five years, is to try to restore the quality of surface water on an operationnal unit, while maintaining a durable and profitable agriculture. During the three first years, the partners - AGPM-TECHNIQUE (Association générale des producteurs de maïs), UIPP (Union des industries de la protection des plantes), ITCF (Institut technique des céréales et des fourrages), SRPV (Service de la protection des végétaux), Cemagref, Brittany territorial communities, DRAF Brittany, chambre d'agriculture d'Ille-et-Vilaine_ - decided, with the support and active participation of the farmers, the setting up of concrete actions through an ambitious action plan, including the evaluation of the level of water contamination, the diagnosis of contamination sources, the inventory and eventual modification of agricultural practices, as well as the first adjustments of cultivated surface. After three years of strong efforts requiring wide skills, the realisation obtained on the place can be reported and permit the issue of first trends. The measurements realised during the year 2000 at the exit of the watershed show a significant pesticide residue decrease in water. This report evaluates the prospects of this exemplar action which could be a reference to generalise the solutions experimented there."	fontaine du theil
524	Implementation of an integrated approach for the diagnosis of river weirs: study of the Cère, Jordanne and Authre rivers in the Cantal region. This paper describes the integrated approach used for inspecting small weirs on three rivers in the department of Cantal. They were small, low-drop weirs (1 to 4 meters), most of them stone masonry constructions. These weirs, some several hundreds of years old, were constructed for field irrigation or to supply water for mills. Due to lack of maintenance they are now deteriorating at an alarming rate after successive river flooding. The local authorities were concerned about the situation and called for a study of all the weirs. Over and above the simple civil engineering inspection required at the start of the analysis, considerations undertaken finally incorporated the various hydraulic, hydrobiological and heritage aspects surrounding the existence and operation of the weirs. The study established a hierarchy of priority classes for work to be done , which, together with a multi-criteria analysis, led to the establishment of a programme for renovating the 20 most critical of the total of 160 weirs.	river flooding;river weirs
525	"Land development of the multi-functionality of agriculture in a sample of collective project. The analysis of CTE's projects in 22 departments as "" action systems "" shows a large variety, which is determinated by identity of actors involved in the projects and by structures of coordination they have built. Different conceptions of agriculture multifunctionnality, interpretations of what is a territory, uses of the CTE policy fit with the types we describe. The "" institutional "" type, carried out by the departmental professional organisations is the most common. This situation is the product of the political weight of these institutions, the consequences of the uncertainty of the policy during the first months of its application, the effect of administrative standardisation due to the necessary adjustment of national and European policies. However, the cases studied show that this return to top-down logic ; at the opposite of the spirit of the law, is not necessarily irremediable."	agriculture

This work was carried out in support of LITEAU project (Cemagref, Ifremer, Bordeaux I university) developed with the aim to study the coupling between land-use and coastal lagoon processes in the Arcachon Basin and its catchment area. Macroalgal blooming as a result of eutrophication has been observed during the last twenty years in the area. A spatial information system was designed in order to compute nitrogen mass balances at relevant spatial and time scales. An inventory of existing data was made in various fields: land-use and human activities, climate, soil, hydrology, vegetation~Functional conceptual sub-units were defined in the Arcachon Bay and its catchment area as well as relevant time scales. An UML (Unified Modelling Language) model was built and a database prototype (using ArcView® and Microsoft Access®) designed for setting thematic and spatial queries. This information system linked with hydrological and hydrodynamic models can be helpful to understand changes in the lagoon (primary producers) upon changing nutrient loadings at different key periods."	
527	Implementation of an integrated management of a bird crop pest in Reunion Island. Integrated management of agricultural pest birds is an alternative of chemical and mechanical actions, and it is in keeping with the general pattern of sustainable agriculture. Taking into account of a multiple partners in research/engenery/action, and of multiple levels of administration and biological organizations, is a way of this management construction. We have applied this to resolve fruit production damage by a bird recently introduced on Reunion island. Multiple level method was involved in the construction of a pluri-organization work group, in the methods and first results of a population biology thesis, and in the application strategies. We present here some results that illustrate the interest of hierarchical steps in decision making.	bird;agriculture;agricultural pest birds;population
528	Model for prospective study of farms. This paper sets out the characteristics and the main results from a predictive model created to identify the future strategies of stock breeders in Auvergne and Limousin. It evaluates the role that might be played by certain alternative farming methods in these plans. This model does not predict future behaviour of the breeders in these two regions. By linking typology to a decision-making process which combines the contribution of a projected approach and a standard approach, it enables the main possible developments of stock breeding in these two regions to be identified, as well as the events and actions which might influence this development. Account is taken of the essential diversity of the situation and behaviour that are typical of this population.	breeders;model
529	Modelling diversified production systems: a case study of dairy farms combined with agroforestry orchards. In the context of the new CAP, the environmental conditionality of direct payments is likely to induce important changes in the technical pathway of the farms. In this paper we focus our analysis of the conditions for development of extensive orchards by modelling mixed crop livestock farms which incorporate orchards. We construct a mathematical programming model enabling us to simulate various intensification levels characterizing the techniques adopted within the different farm production units (cattle breeding, forage fields, arboriculture). This model also enables us to take into account some environmental indicators relative to the use of these techniques. Moreover, the method used allows us to illustrate technical complementarities existing within the diversified systems, which results in joint production through non allocable inputs instead of joint production through allocable inputs. The MP model is notably used to calculate the level of the minimum premium, which could incite the farmer to fulfil some environmental requirements, through increasing the proportion of agro forestry orchards on the farm system.	orchards
530	Modelling of landscape maintenance by herbivores in highlands: a multi-agent approach. The surrender of herbaceous resources by the grazing activity results in an impoverishment of both ecological and specific diversity. On the long term, this trend imposes the localization of human activities far from these zones and a national imbalance. A multidisciplinary research program was set up in 1994 with the aim of elaborating new ways of management, which would contribute to maintain both the productivity and the opened landscapes within the condition of low grazing pressure. This paper exposes the methods we elaborated in order to test several management techniques of grasslands by mean of cattle and horses within the hypothesis of complementarity between these two species. The computer science part of this paper presents the results of simulations of future dynamic behaviors of the animals, vegetation and landscape, in order to propound some management protocols. The simulator is based on a multi-agent system. The conceptual model, formalized with Unified Modeling Language graphical notation is actually in validation phase and the implementation of the software was done in the Java programming language. The following of the animals in the field was done by means of GPS equipments and the animal activity was recorded by Ethosys equipments.	animals;landscape maintenance
531	Synthetic modelling of floods: hydrological models of flow, duration and frequency and hydraulic models. We need to modelize the available hydrological knowledge on floods, in order to give to all the concerned people objective and quantified elements for the negotiation, concerning flood risk but also hazard and vulnerability. These elements must be mapped, because a large part of the negotiation is territorial and landed. These elements need also to be continuous and reversible, to not constraint too much the negotiation that need flexibility and also a clear display of the consequences of the different choices.	floods
532	Taking uncertainty into account in pesticide fate modelling. Pesticide fate models play an important role in risk assessment procedures for registration of crop protection products both in Europe and in the US. Although sources of uncertainty in pesticide fate modelling are numerous, uncertainty is not explicitly taken into account within current procedures for registration modelling. The paper briefly reviews the main sources of variability leading to uncertainty in model input parameters and present a Monte Carlo framework for taking uncertainty into account in the modelling. The approach is more realistic and transparent than the traditional risk quotient approach and is likely to benefit all stakeholders, from the public through the industry to the regulators.	pesticide

These changes imply a deep evolution in the tasks and therefore in the skills of the « cleanliness manager ».	evolution
534	Freshwater molluscs and biodegradable pollution of watercourses: scale of sensitivity of species, genera and families. Malacological surveys and physico-chemical water analysis have been carried out at one hundred and sixty stations in France, distributed across five major catchment areas. The relationships between six of the variables: dissolved oxygen, BOD5, ammonia nitrogen, nitrites, Kjeldhal nitrogen and orthophosphates can be considered as indicators of biodegradable pollution and the populations of forty eight species of molluscs have been studied using correspondence analysis. A scale of sensitivity of these species to this type of pollution is presented here. Using these results as a basis, and introducing of supplementary elements in the analysis, we have been able to formulate a scale of sensitivity of mollusc genera and families. A quantification of information lost when using genus or family-level rather than species-level identification was carried out. The results obtained showed that the genus-level identification can constitute an acceptable compromise for using molluscs as water quality indicators in biomonitoring.	water;france;freshwater;oxygen
535	"The multiple functions of agriculture and contracts of territory exploitation. Beyond production's functions and new requirements in regards to quality and security, the society's requirements toward agriculture assert themselves in different fields that are environmental, social (employement, rural tissue maintaining) and cultural (gastronomy, landscapes, national heritage). These multiple functions and their stakes are now at the center of the French and European agricultural politics and they will be taken into consideration during international negociations. Today, contracts of territory exploitation, implemented by the lawmaker and the French government, are the main tool of this reorientation. This concept, in order to better be taken into account within public politics, must be the subject of researches that mobilise several scientific disciplines. This special release especially deals with the first reconstitution of the work done by INRA' and CEMAGREF' researchers about the multiple functions of agriculture. This reconstitution happens on the 12th and 13th of december 2000 at Clermont-Ferrand in the framework of the seminary called ""First sights on the multiple functions of agriculture through the implement of contracts of territory exploitation."	agriculture
536	Multifunctionality and sustainable development of rural territories in Europe: state of the art and new research challenges. In this article an overview of the emergence of the concept of multifunctionality is given. Particular emphasis is on interrelationships with territorial approaches. The article is based on the results of the Multagri European research project. The multiplicity of meanings and works dealing with the concept of multifunctionality of agriculture and rural areas has been the starting point of this project. A mapping of the different streams of research was elaborated. As a result of this analysis, it was suggested that research should detach itself from multifunctionality as a political goal and should instead consider multifunctionality as a useful conceptual and analytical framework. To support this recommendation, directions for this analytical framework are sketched out. Then, the article introduces the notion of territoryand discusses its relevance in the multifunctionality debate. The analytical framework that is being proposed, links multifunctionality and sustainability. It reflects the idea of a continuum between scales in a more global sustainable perspective. Research gaps related to these issues are identified and future research perspectives are suggested in several domains: public policies, market and governance.	research;rural areas;europe;art

Since the French agricultural act of July 1999, a new tool was established to promote the multifunctionality of agriculture and to favour the adaptation of farms to social expectations. This tool is a farm contract, called ""contrat territorial d'exploitation (CTE)"". The CTE is based upon a farm diagnostic assessment. In this paper we offer a discussion about multifunctionality and farm assessment concepts and we stress on the qualities which are required to carrying out a farm diagnostic assessment with the intention of contracting a CTE. Then the farm diagnosis practices, in a sampling of 14 French departments, are assessed."	agriculture
538	Concepts of hydro-ecology and biological quality of running waters. This paper focuses on a brief review of some general principles in freshwater ecology (nutrient cycling, trophic nets). The main effects of human pollution are listed and several simple field methods of pollution effect assessment proposed. The European and French contexts (European framework, SEQ of Water Agencies) stimulate integrated approaches by simultaneously using several standardized biomonitoring indices. Three standardized indices are commonly used in French biomonitoring nets : IBGN (invertebrates), IBD (diatoms) and IOBS (oligochaetes). Two other methods are on the course of standardization (IBMR, macrophytes, and a fish index). Prospects for fundamental and applied researches on the biomonitoring of running waters are also mentioned.	hydro ecology;waters;freshwater ecology
539	"New dwellers, news jobs. Sensitive"" areas are defined, within the scope of this paper, as rural areas with low density population which have experienced or are experiencing negative population developments. The population deficiency for them constitutes one of the main handicaps to the (presumed) research for a new development, especially through the difficulty to find local human resources to take care for it. However, it seems that we are now witnessing, even in low-density rural areas, a population development which is not uniformly negative, with interesting migration phenomena : this point is the subject of a first exposition. The economic development is necessary to keep the local population, or even to attract new residents, and at the same time, this latter one can be stimulated through the reception of new populations. The point of view adopted in this paper is the one of development at the service of local life, in favouring the questions of relation between activities, jobs and demography, of the sharing-out and distribution of activities within sensitive areas. After a recalling of agricultural and industrial activity sectors, the reception functions of rural territories are initially examined as a whole, in considering all the forms of population reception having resources from external origin (pensioners, commuting migrants, tourists, ...), then in developing the example of scattered rural tourism. Finally, in relying on these analyses, contribution ways for Research to public action are set in prospects."	population;jobs;rural areas

In the past, the main objections were based on the smells produced during and after slurry spreading. Nowadays, conflict between pig farmers and people living in the surrounding area has increased considerably as a result of odours emitted from pig buildings and pig storage. The aim of this paper is to describe sources and locations of odour emissions in order to have a general survey of the problem and the technical issues available to deal with the problem.	pig;france

Space observation of the continental biosphere has been the object of a growing development since this technique offers large possibilities in the fields of water management and soil characterization. In this article, we will present the most recent developments oriented towards the determination of parameters which describe free waters and which manage the water cycle, as well as of parameters which manage the lateral and vertical flow redistribution. We will then present the national and international context through large international programs and through the various research teams that work in this field. Finally, we will discuss the perspectives foreseen for the coming years, and the research topics necessary to meet the current requirements.	water;space observation;research;biosphere
542	Land occupation and flooding. Each flood renews the polemic on establishing responsibilities. This paper aims to produce a bibliographic analysis of the relation between land occupation and flooding. It must first of all be remembered that flooding is caused by heavy rain and that, above a certain intensity, the effects of factors connected with the occupation of the area become secondary, if not negligible. This paper refers to certain fairly recent developments such as the increase of forests, the changes in population, the regression of agricultural land, the considerable reduction in the number of hedgerows, the recent slowing down in drainage and the increase of impermeable surfaces. Brittany is an example of how these developments vary in France. The bibliographic study emphasises the major role of the forests, notably pinewoods, on levelling out floods and increasing the volume of run-off water noted on cultivated land, especially during the winter. Amalgamating fields, in particular the work associated with this, can have a certain influence on the consequences of low to medium rainfall. Grubbing up hedges can increase the peak flow of small floods. Drainage can have contradictory effects, noticeably reducing the run-off water as well as increasing the volume of water evacuated. It is, however, difficult to determine its effect on the whole basin. More than land drainage, changes in the size of the open ditch network as well as downstream rivers has in general aggravated flooding. Town planning, with the increase in impermeable surfaces, shortens the response time. In conclusion, emphasis is placed on the need to continue studies and research and various subjects for consideration are put forward.	flooding;water
543	Optimal settings and use for hose reel gun irrigation system. Irrigation by hose reel gun is the most popular irrigation method in France, but water application quality remains often poor. Specially, the sensivity to wind strongly affects water distribution and increases local rainfall intensity. A semi-empirical model was developed in Cemagref, calculating spatial water distribution accounting for wind. Tests were carried out in field conditions in co-operation with Arvalis-Institute, to calibrate the model. This model was integrated with a crop model and an irrigation scheduling model allowing to simulate water distribution in an agricultural plot over several irrigation seasons. This simulation tool has been used to diagnose farmers practices and to evaluate scenarios improving water application performance. This tool was used in various areas to propose optimal settings according to climatic conditions. An example is given on potatoes in Picardie (Northern France).	water;france;irrigation;wind;agricultural;gun irrigation;gun

The mitigation of the nonpoint source pollution resulting from the agrosystèmes is a major stake from the environmental point of view according the water quality conservation exposed in the European directive (2000/60/EC). The interdisciplinary project ArtWET deals with the potential remediation offered by the wetlands and proposes a global approach, from laboratory to the in situ-prototype, taking into account the interactions of the biological and physical processes within artificial and optimized systems. The expected results and the dissemination of knowledge must lead to the adoption of such low cost devices on the whole European territory.	pesticide;agricultural;wetlands
546	Optimization of wastewater treatment in rainy weather: unitary sanitation and nitrifying activated sludge. Municipal wastewater treatment plants down-stream from combined sewerage systems have to treat greater volumes of water in wet weather, especially when applying the new regulations introduced in the Water legislation. This article deals with activated sludge, the main process used for treating waste water. It analyses the reasonable limitations on pollutants entering the system, the consequences on the size of plants required as well as design and operation, following the sequence of water treatment stages. Although it does not consider an exhaustive approach or outline explicitly all the multiple links between works, this article considers what modifications should be made to process the additional volume of waste water during wet weather.	water;weather;wastewater
547	Sewage sludge characterization: new improvements to optimize treatments. According to the current social economical and environmental context, sewage sludge production is increasing and their management is of major concern. On a practical point of view, to limit the volumes and to assure their valorisation success (for example agricultural spreading), it is necessary to optimize sludge secondary treatment and to characterize their consistency. With this purpose, taking into account the difficulties the professionals are confronted with, we focused on the combined contribution between rheological and electrical measurements, the latter aiming at overcoming the lack of knowledge about sludge composition. Indeed, though rheology is a performing tool, it needs a real expertise and often expensive equipments, whereas electrical measurements are cheaper and easier to perform. The similarities existing between rheological and electrical domains just as the use of electrical techniques to analyse materials such as concrete (which has a behaviour close to sludge) leads us to choose conductivity measurements and electrical impedance spectroscopy as new ways of analysis.Thus, in order to substitute electrical for rheological measurements during sludge treatment process and also to develop our knowledge of sludge behaviour we studied both sludge and other materials. Through the study of many parameters (concentration, pH, aging, temperature), we demonstrated the importance of the nature of the charges, bound or free, on electrical and rheological characteristics of the material. Moreover, similarly to liquid electrolytes or solids as rocks, we established the existence of a relationship between the conductivity and the viscosity of pasty materials. Secondly, this analytical method was applied to sewage sludge. The impact of many parameters on the electrical and rheological behaviour of sewage sludge was determined : dry content, temperature, fermentation degree, salts. That allowed us to improve sludge's characterization and to determine an indicator for their dewaterability which would lead to a better control of sewage sludge treatment processes. The purpose of this communication is to show the potential of this double analytical method based on the combination of rheological and electrical measurements on sewage sludge.	sewage
548	Tools for ecological engineering: diagnoses and functional biomonitoring of rivers. Restoration of freshwater ecosystems requires a better understanding of hydrosystem function. The EASY concept assumes that the biocenoses are strongly related to the organic and mineral inputs and to the assimilation ability. These biological processes stay into some Functional Units composing the river mosaic. Functional Traits are examined by means of benthic and hyporheic invertebrate assemblages. A predictive tool is implemented with respect of the tolerance of Chironomidae to toxic pollution. Qualitative indexes appear useful and even better predictive as soon as they are gathered into a harmonisation system. Our present objectives are to make up tools for functional biomonitoring, at the scale of a basin, able to fulfill the WFD challenge of remediation.	ecological engineering
549	Decision-making tools for accidental pollution management of rivers: toward sustainable solutions. Industries regularly interface with natural environment. The natural environment is often impacted when accidental industrial pollution occurs. Classical procedure makes use of physico-chemical analyses to state the pollution of the environment. However, diagnosis on the living is often neglected in this inventory. The authors suggest an approach adapted to rivers to identify the impacts on the living. This approach may be a decisional tool for field operationals and a first step towards rehabilitation or ecological restoration of environment.	environment;natural environment;pollution;accidental
550	Embankment hydraulic structures: a transverse look at the action of water. The water flows through an earthdam, its foundation and its supports. The work can even be exceptionally flowed above. The action of the water is varied and multi-scale in time and in space. This variety reflects in the variety of disciplines having contributed directly or not, to the comprehension of phenomenon and to the modelling of some of these phenomenon. Besides the well admitted fact that the advanced situate to interface of several disciplines, a global vision of influence of water puts in obviousness two results. First, the current models, simple or sophisticated, are only punctual and explanatory. Their predictive character is tenuous, perhaps non-existent. The real numerical model utilization is the reconstitution and the explanation of facts passed. Observation on site, mostly in case of accident or flood are essential for the validation of models. Secondly, a part of phenomenon and several successions of phenomenon escape modelling. This puts in before 1) importance of surveillance; 2) importance of the capacity to make a diagnosis based on experience (expertise).	water

552	"Public participation to flood mitigation management: using 'Flood-Scale' procedure and contingent valuation. Despite the existence of a ""participation principle"" in the environmental law,the French public does not participate to mitigation decisions and flood risk management. This paper describes a tool designed to overcome this difficulty in the case of typically French centralized decision-making. Such a tool is based both on adapting the contingent valuation method to the risky context of floods and on using a specific flood-scale procedure designed to give people the best relevant information. The results of a survey in the urban area of Le Mans are discussed. The fact that willingness to pay does not increase with the protection level tends to prove that there is an acceptability for such a flood risk, even for people facing the more important ones. This result supports the need for earlier stake-holder participation in the decision-making process."	flood

Their design, original by the fact that they are permeable, has been constantly adapted to the development of the Rhône river schemes from 1939 to 1987. Their regular monitoring allows to detect any operating disorders related to an increase of the hydraulic discharge or gradient, or due to the uplifts. Each disorder detected is the object of a report, a diagnosis, and if necessary, a reinforcement. Three different cases are detailed up to the experience feed back of reinforcement. A synthesis based on the whole monitoring and maintenance over the last ten years allows to appreciate the whole techniques in order to perform the works operation.	design;river;drainage

A study carried out in the non-centralised departments of the ministries in charge of agriculture, forestry and environment enabled a greater understanding of the impact of forestry work on the landscape. This is described on various scales: from a plot to a small natural area, from a plantation to an industrial forest. In addition to the inadequacies and the needs of those involved with this aspect of the landscape, the paper draws conclusions on the need to take an interest in the other users of the countryside about whose expectations little is known.	agriculture;forestry
555	Clay geosynthetic barriers performance in landfill covers: state of the art and proposition for a methodology. Clay geosynthetic barriers (GBR-Cs) used in landfill covers must ensure lining on the long term. The primary mode of ageing of bentonite GBR-Cs in covers is the coupling of cation exchange and hydration-desiccation cycles. The objective of this paper is to synthesize the optimal conditions to prevent a loss of performance of GBR-Cs in covers with time, based on a literature review. Various parameters will be discussed. The literature review will put in light the lack of consistent information from study to study. This enforces the need for a list of information to collect in future excavations. Such a list is proposed in the third section of this paper followed by the presentation of results from recent excavations performed by the first author.	art
556	Pruning period and wound treatment on hardwoods. The pruning times, and the behaviour and comparative effectiveness of four pruning protection products available on the French market for broadleaved species, were monitored over a period of three years. The research on the influence of pruning times was carried out on beech and wild cherry, whilst the effect of product treatment was conducted on wild cherry alone. At the end of the third and final year of experimentation, internal infection of the wood and the characterisation of any present or absent pathogens was monitored in the majority of pruned specimens taken from all four sites after felling, with samples being taken for laboratory analysis from those regions where the wood exhibited any changes.	research;wood
557	"Pluriactivity and seasonality - Strengths for regional development. Pluriactivity and seasonality, which are some traditional mountain activities, are still very much in vigor. They are the symbol of very diverse situations, from precarity to a strong desire to learn. These practices are also part of a social insertion logics, as well as of a logics of attachment to local resources and adaptation to the socio-economical context. The ""non-typical job systems"" therefore represent an important challenge with respect to land management, and must be part of the reflexions to be engaged about social aknowledgment and status."	
558	Water policy: the future of our rivers is decided in Chicago too. Agricultural « futures » are exchanged daily in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Group as in Paris, in order to alleviate some risks for the farmers, an objective shared with agricultural insurances or crop diversifications. It is among these varied tools that the place of irrigation must be reconsidered. This implies that any change of either any hazard concerning the farms or any tools to fight them (from the change of the Common Agricultural Policy to the spread of new financial derivatives) is likely to imply consequences on the irrigated surfaces and on the water volumes used for irrigation. The dispersion of the irrigated areas may also be changed, with non negligible consequences on the environment and the land settlement.	agricultural;irrigation;water
559	Public policy and territories: teachings from public policy. This article reproduces a paper delivered at the Conference entitled « Gestion des territoires ruraux: connaissances et méthodes pour la décision publique », in Clermont-Ferrand on April 27-28, 1998. It deals the issue of the spatial incidence of public policies. There is a complicated overlapping of the territories concerned with public action due to the fragmentation both horizontal and vertical of public decision. This fragmentation leads to a difficulty to recognize where decisions are taken and questions the effectivity of public policies. However, the main factors of success for policies with spatial incidence can now be determined because of the development of public policy analysis these last ten years. Among them: networking politico-administrative actors : facilitating the overlapping of the different tiers of government appears to be more important than strengthening any one of them; the concensus needed to achieve public action: the current logics of public policy « co-production » requires the differents partners to support a common policy; the last factor is the importance of public policy evaluation : it is necessary for the different actors to develop their ability to assess the process in progress. The article develops these three points and presents some recommandations as concluding remarks.	
560	Chemical and bacterial pollution of stormwater urban runoff in Stang Alar Basin. Characterization study of urban runoff pollution was conducted in Brest (France). Traditional parameters were analyzed, T.S.S, TKN, COD, TOC,... metals, hydrocarbons and bacteria ( total coliforms and Escherichia coli ). In general, on a mass basis, heavy metals,oxygen-demanding, suspended solids and bacteria in urban stormwater are significant. Water pollution comes from urban stormwater discharges and combined sewer overflows. Chemical pollutants are mainly related to total suspended solids excepted for low concentrations. Concentrations and flow varied considerably for different storm events. Intensity of rain as well as inter-events dry periods between two successive rainfall events are the main factors for explanation of mass pollution discharge. Most of separate stormwater drainage systems fonction as combined systems because of cross sanitary sewers and it seems to be the major cause of identified coliforms in urban stormater discharges. Chemical pollution only appears during storm events but bacteria are still present for several days in the river after those events.	france;water;chemical;bacteria
561	Non-point pollution in watersheds in western France: what data should be collected for diagnosis?. To trace non point source agricultural pollution on a watershed, one needs to analyse the impact of the watershed's physical characteristics, of the diversity of agricultural practices and of their spatial and temporal interactions. Because these phenomena are very complex, many teams are involved in developing models to better understand occuring processes. But on a real watershed it is not possible to continuously measure all the parameters that are required for these models: a very important question is to measure and survey the less bad information. The description of this information is the aim of this paper: the possible surveys, depending on the scale, the problems and the diagnosis methods are first described. Then some methods of data acquisition for soils, crops and agricultural practices are compared. These descriptions are illustrated by examples on some watersheds surveyed by our team.	agricultural;france;watershed
562	Herbaceous vegetation restoration of urban sandy areas Assessment of urban greenspaces management. Some towns have decided to stop chemical weed control of sandy areas and to transform them into herbaceous plant communities. There is a need for a global assessment of management techniques and their consequences for plant cover. A survey of such practices has been conducted in 13 towns. Vegetation has been recorded at 56 sites within 9 towns. This field study aims to assess the influence of various factors in vegetation restoration. The survey showed that restoration measure may be efficient ; the slowness of the installation of spontaneous herbaceous vegetation may be a problem for the managers of green spaces because it is sometimes negatively perceived by the citizens. Therefore, appropriate communication explaining objectives and interests of these practices is essential to increase their acceptance by the local population.	sandy areas;urban sandy areas
563	Regional potential and quality approaches in the case of the Drôme fishery. A regional strategy to improve value and quality must be based on a sound knowledge of production methods, the local quality potential and the likely causes of any possible reduction in quality. For conducting such a strategy and drawing up a specification for fruit growers, the author suggests an approach based on a production scheduling scheme and an analysis of the variations in production quality observed throughout the region. The paper describes the method proposed and the results obtained for the Pêche Label Rouge de la Drôme (peaches).	production;production scheduling
564	Defining ecological engineering in relation to sustainable development and ecology. Ecological engineering was defined several decades ago, both in the academic field and - at least in France - in management. However, ecological engineering seems to be re-emerging as an academic field and as a cornerstone concept in French ecologists' writings. We first summarize Barbault et Pavé (2003)'s point of view on why ecological engineering now seems rehabilitated. We next propose a definition of ecological engineering, in accordance with the two reasons for its re-emergence, i.e. the prevalence of the concept of sustainable development and the development of applied ecological sub-disciplines. We end the paper by discussing some problems and characteristics of ecological engineering that stem from this definition.	ecological engineering;ecology
565	For a better recognition of the diversity of agriculture by institutions: example of the Vosges mountains. A field study carried out in two valleys in the Vosges massif showed a high degree of diversity in the nature of the farms and the combinations of professional activity in each household. While this diversity is acknowledged, it is poorly catered for by institutional organisations. The farmers receiving the best training and benefiting most from development aid are those succeeding their parents. The desire of the main parties in the area is to maintain farming activity and the open landscape. This requires recognition of different farming methods, and not just by public services and agricultural development authorities. In our view it also requires new developments in research into how households function.	agriculture;farmers
566	Practicing volumetric management on a departmental scale: inventory and analysis through a modeling approach. In the actual context of agriculture, the irrigation water management is a main issue to preserve water and promote an agriculture which is both competitive and environment friendly. In many French departments, innovative water management practices are set up. The volumetric water management allows an equal access to water for each farmer using irrigation by awarding water quota to each another. In this article, by a ground survey and an industrial modelling approach, we propose to identify and characterize the main activities and information used in volumetric water management. We then discuss the interest of these models to evaluate the various organizations and to design new information and management systems.	water;agriculture;irrigation
567	"Agricultural practices and water quality in a small intensive breeding area : a pilot experiment carried out within the framework of the ""Rade de Brest"" contract. A 3-year multidisciplinary research programme, supported by the EU as part of its ""Life "" pilot experimental scheme, has enabled the scientific bases of the Brest Harbour contract to be established. The agricultural aspects of this programme were undertaken jointly by Cemagref Rennes and the INRA. Investigations concentrated on a 6 sq. km watershed known as the Kerouallon Basin. This watershed, which is given over to very intensive livestock farming, is situated in a Manure Surplus Area. Farming practice across 250 parcels was closely observed over a two-year period years. The presence of nitrogen, phosphorous, pesticide and heavy metal in agricultural products, the ground and the water were analysed. This enabled us to establish a diagnosis of agricultural pollution at parcel, farm and basin levels. Proposals were then made to the farmers concerning economically-viable alterations to their farming practice to take into account environmental problems. A bottom-up approach was adopted - firstly, reduction of inefficient techniques currently used by the farmers, secondly, introduction of modern practice regarding animal feeds, effluent management, crop rotation rationalization and lower-risk rotations, finally, land development for depolluting the residual waste flow."	pilot;water;pesticide;agricultural;farmers;programme;watershed;research
568	Evaluation of the action on the hydrographic area of Auradé (Gers). The first aim of this study was the evaluation of the impact of agricultural production on the stream water quality. After this first statement of the water quality degradation, an action was launched in order to recover the quality of the resource. Grassed buffer strips devices were settled along the stream to demonstrate the efficiency of these protections in the reduction of the contamination. The following step is the improvement of the agricultural practices, by limiting chemicals treatments, and by a global approach on the crop rotations. Aware of the water quality results, a technical work group thought about the practices of the main crops of the area: sunflower and wheat. The protocol indicates the appropriated strategies of weed control, specifies for each pest, the periods, observations, treatment thresholds, and appropriated chemical products, and evaluates technically and economically these new itineraries. A list of products is proposed to the farmers in order to substitute or diversify depending on the efficacy, the characteristics of the substances, and the chemical products available on the two local dealers. The results of the first campaign show the good enforcement of the farmers. Moreover, the measurement of the water quality seems to put forward a lower impact of these itineraries on water quality. These results are encouraging but need to be checked during the following campaigns.	water;farmers;agricultural
569	First adaptations by cattle breeders in the face of the reformed CAP. A survey was carried out at the end of 1993. 35 beef meat producing farms were involved. As a result the first adaptations of cattle breeders to the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform were pin-pointed. A first and immediate kind of adaptations aims at optimizing the declaration filled out for obtaining compensatory benefits. This shows how well stock breeders have appropriated such a complex procedure. A second kind of adaptations, from a tchnical as well as structural point of view, do in fact meet the objectives of the CAP reform. Extensification and enlargement of farms were speeded up and inputs supplies were reduced.	cattle;agricultural;cattle breeders;breeders
570	First approaches to an experimental method for the study of flows in highway retention basins. Reservoirs collect natural motorway wastes and pollutants from accidental spills as well. The article is reporting an experimental study about a miscible pollutant transfer according to the reservoir characteristics : shape, vegetation, inlet jet, etc. The collected data will enable to calibrate a numerical model used as a model to build a gauging chart, in order to make the time transfer longer than the current time limit to come to the place where accident occurs. We first describe the experimental method : water level, flow, concentration and speed measurements. The second part gives some results. According to the reservoir, we deduced that a plate with holes in front of the inlet jet or a good distribution of the vegetation could reduce speed flow. The first numerical tests give a time transfer comparable to the measured time. 	
571	First lessons from a European network of comparative plantations of hybrid larch varieties (Larix x eurolepis Henry). Hybrid larch is much appreciated by forest owners. However, hybrid seed production is often too scarce to meet national demand. Forest Reproductice Material importation could be a solution but that would require specific knowledge on European orchard quality. With that purpose, several research institutes jointly compared eight seedlots from seven orchards in seven sites across Europe. Survival, growth in height and diameter, and stem form were assessed at all sites in winter 2000/01 using a common protocol. Despite large variations in the environmental factors, the seed lots performed in a similar way in the different sites and, on average, the hybrids were more vigorous and at least as straight as the Japanese and European larch controls. An exception was FP 237 which had a very poor growth regardless of planting site. The most vigorous varieties were Esbeek, FH 201, Vaals and Halle; those with the best stem straightness were FP 237, FH 201 and Esbeek. At this early stage, Esbeek and FH 201 offer the best compromise for form and vigour. In addition, the results found at La Courtine were confirmed by further measurements carried out four years later.	seed
572	Prediction by trapping of cheimatobie outbreaks in the forest. In oak woods of Val-de-Saône, the following up during 8 years of the adults Winter moth fluctuations with trap trees and pheromon traps have showed the female capture to be a good population indicator. The main role of concurence acting between the pheromonal emissions of the two types of traps and those of females present on all the trees in the forest, was demonstrated during an outbreak phase. This can explain the observed shortage in the male progression, then its locking when females captures increase, as well the trapping sex-ratio variation during the time. The use of these indicators is discussed for a survey anr forecasting strategy.	strategy

This paper describes the various diseases of A. baeri in aquaculture. This study does not show any specific pathogenic agent. Causes of some pathological conditions are not clearly identified. Furthermore, two bacteria proved to be the most virulent, Flexibacter columnaris and especially Yersinia ruckeri. Prevention methods will have to be developped.	sturgeon;siberian sturgeon
574	"Consideration of the landscape by the forestry services in charge of private forests - Example of a continuing education policy. Why do we have to maintain biodiversity in forest ecosystems and how can we do it ? How can we convert general principles of conservation into technical advice without falling into the trap of theoretical or badly adapted recommendations ? This article tries to answer these questions by giving first the scope of forest biodiversity maintenance. Then, we note that the preservation of biodiversity through management practises is not entirely operational. In order to achieve better efficiency, it is necessary to define specific objectives in accordance with spatial scale and the ecological and economic contexts and to adapt the technical practises to these constraints. We suggest (i) raising the variance of some ecological parameters such as forest disturbance regime and stand composition and (ii) increasing the average of others such as the amount of deadwood and the surface areas covered by early - and late-successional stages. The relevance of these technical choices will be assessed by monitoring the biodiversity. Furthermore, we suggest that our classic forest management should be changed in favour of the American concept of ""adaptive management"", a more flexible type of management based on close links between research and practice."	ecological;forests

We will also present the various stages of the extension program, specificities of such a program when it is addressed to the attention of a professional public and the first lessons drawn from these vocational training.	forests
576	Problem of upwelling, salinity and nitrate pollution of the Beni-Amir groundwater (Tadla, Morocco). The phreatic aquifer of the Beni-Amir irrigated area (Tadla, Morocco) is a plio-quaternary heterogeneous reservoir. Human activities and natural recharge variations have direct effects on temporal groundwater level fluctuations. Indeed the irrigation process of the Beni-Amir area, has led to groundwater table rise problems. Hence, several thousands of hectares of this area have been flooded from groundwater table rise ; afterwards groundwater and soil quality become deteriorated due to their salinisation. In this work, we present a hydrogeological analysis and characterisation of the study area: hydrodynamic parameters, space and temporal piezometric variation in order to characterise the hydrogeological behavior of the aquifer system. The results show that the groundwater table rise is directly due to the recharge from irrigated water and irrigation practices, in addition to a no suitable water drainage system. The piezometric maps show that two zones are permanently affected by the groundwater table rise problem. A diagnosis of groundwater pollution by salt and nitrate accumulation has shown a net deterioration of groundwater quality due to the practices of the irrigation management and fertilizers, in addition to groundwater recycling from pumping wells.	water;flooded;morocco;irrigation;groundwater pollution
577	Pig slurry treatment processes studied in France: main techniques adapted to the management of slurry in areas of structural surplus. Because of their large size, many above-ground animal breeding units (especially pig units) producing manure are confronted with environmental problems. Apart from the difficulty of rationally managing the effluent by spreading the manure on farming land, the problems are aggravated in sensitive areas by the smells and in certain areas where there is a high concentration of breeding units, by the excess fertiliser produced. Farms have to change quickly to meet environmental protection regulations. Treatment techniques may have to be used in an attempt to resolve these problems. These techniques incur additional costs which have to be estimated depending on the various processes that can be envisaged and the financial arrangements that may have to be made. This paper deals with pig manure and is divided into three sections: the first part summarises the main characteristics of pig manure and the various forms of fertilising elements it contains; the second part defines the treatments and their aims and the third part describes the characteristics and results of the main processes studied in France.	france
578	Processes in vertical-flow reed beds - nitrification, oxygen transfer and soil clogging. Vertical-flow reed beds (VF) with intermittent feeding are extremely reliable regarding aerobic processes. For a save operation with high nitrification rates and without soil clogging it is essential to preserve aerobic conditions in the filter. The challenge is to keep aerobic conditions in the filter without oversizing the system (economical aspects). It is very difficult to determine the current oxygen content in the filters because it ultimately results from complex interactions of a large number of different influencing parameters such as loading rate, degree of clogging, temperature, and hydraulic behaviour of the reed bed. To gain better knowledge of this complex system, different tests and examinations were carried out over several years. Focussing the questions of identification and the description of conversion and transport processes (water/gas), a full scale treatment plant under clogged and non-clogged conditions was investigated in detail. Additionally soil column test were carried out. The results make it possible to describe some of the processes and their interactions in the filter body. Recommendations for a safe and controlled operation can be derived.	oxygen;current oxygen
579	"Agricultural profession and nature protection associations: a constructive confrontation? Observations in Indre and Cher departments (France). The Agricultural Policy Law adopted on the 9th of July 1999 introduced the Land Management Contract (LMC). This new tool allows the remunaration of non marketable functions of agriculture. The LMC also ensures a better coherence between rural development (Rural Development Decision) and the market prices due to the common agricultural policy (CAP). The Departmental Committees of Agricultural Policy ("" CDOA "") are widened to associations for the protection nature. This participation is difficult in the Indre and Cher departments (Centre region). The agricultural profession doesn't acknowledge the relevance of associative work, particularly in the Indre. About twenty interviews farmers reveal different approaches in the agricultural world. In the studied context, the CDOA doesn't seem to be the place for a constructive confrontation. The mobilisation of associations remains weak and new methods (training courses, skill exchanges) have to be implemented in order to reach the LMC goals."	agricultural;farmers;prices
580	Reinforcement project of the levee of the « Val d'Authion ». Strengthening the levee of Val d'Authion was declared as a public interest project on 31 August 2000. The 2000-2006 contract between the State and the regional authorities is devoted to the definition of the technical solutions and the construction of the strengthening works. The article comments the results of the studies and particularly insists on three aspects : the evaluation of the failure risk, the choice of the technical solutions and the design and dimensions of the watertight barrier. According to the land properties constraints and the geotechnical features along the levee, different technical solutions are recommended. The watertight barrier solution is well adapted to the urban context. The detailed fl ow and seepage analysis and the stability computations for different configurations showed that dimensioning the barrier characteristics is a complex task. The analysis shows the difficulty for defining the safety criteria against piping in the case of old levees.	
581	Proposal of a method to assist consulting. The authors outline the elements of a full support process for the development of collective projects. They place themselves in a context wherein those involved have multiple and interdependent objectives, their fields of intervention and of competence are interlinked, the overall necessity is to establish resources controlled by others and the criteria of a good decision are unclear and external to the deciding powers (sustainable development). The method of the scenarios and prospective analysis are used to express, construct and compare each party's point of view. To do so, modelling (graphs, maps, etc.) is used to highlight the relationships perceived by each party between the objects, between the implications of these objects, and between those concerned by what is at stake (the objects).	
582	Water quality considerations. In the field of public health, as well as in that of protection of freshwater systems, the progress of scientific knowledge has led to a proliferation of quality standards that is all the more incomprehensible to the general public which, having for a long time been outside decision-making circles, has continued to use aesthetic and organoleptic criteria to assess this quality. Moreover, the many different types of possible standards are conflicting and may have unintended effects. There are standards for the processes to be used and standards for the results to be achieved, which can be classified as output standards and input standards. The persistence of public health practices and the closely related tradition of assimilating the risk, in order to eliminate it, lead to deadlock, possibly due to the incoherent demands from the general public. It is far more urgent to move towards an environmental engineering approach, where a procedure of collective apprenticeship of the water qualities required for various uses and for conserving ecosystems, making democratic discussion possible, may permit the establishment of overall management of the resources and risks.	water;freshwater
583	Forecasting world water requirements up to the year 2025. A simple approach was used to forecast municipal, industrial, agricultural and power station water requirements up to the year 2025. These potential requirements were compared against the total water resources of all countries to identify areas that might face the most serious water shortages in the future. The results of this study highlight the need for urgent measures (1) to help to improve irrigation efficiency, (2) to find fair legal solutions for water allocation problems at national and international level and (3) to stop degradation of water resources by pollution.	water;irrigation efficiency;forecast
584	A study method for the protection of the geomembrane against puncturing at landfill sites. Protecting geotextiles are used in the design of watertight bottom liners at landfill sites, above the géomembrane, to protect it against puncture during the installation of the drainage layer and, during the service life, to the weight of the waste to be put in place. To date, the results of the 2 standard tests (static and dynamic tests) given by the technical sheets for the protecting geotextiles are not sufficient to choose the good geotextile. The development of an experimental procedure to simulate in the lab the waste loading conditions is presented here; this procedure uses large size static damage tests and follows a previous study concerning the implementation dynamic conditions (Budka & al., 2006).	design
585	"Prototype of an intensity scale for the phenomenon ""forest fire"".. The study financed by the Ministry of Ecology and sustainable Development aims at determining an intensity scale for the forest fire hazard which should enable to classify any forest fire a posteriori, occurring on the French Metropolitan Territory as well as in the Overseas Departments according to its intensity level. The article presents how a first prototype was elaborated, considering that no existing intensity scale has been registered in this area. From an international bibliography and surveys done by experts, the identification of some physical fire parameters and possible damages on types of stakes was performed, the accessibility of aimed data was also studied. The prototype is presented in the form of a table, in which the values of the physical parameters as well as the corresponding damages on specific stakes are summed up for each of the six defined levels (very low, low, average, high, very high, exceptional). This scale was previously assessed by a panel of experts, and will have to be tested by decentralised state services on coming events up to the end of the year 2002."	prototype;fire
586	Product quality and anchoring to the terroir: the case of the Massif Central AOC cheese sectors. Cheese brands having an « Origin Verified Designation » (OVD = label of quality) represent high economical stakes for the « Massif Central » area and the « Auvergne » region especially. Ten cheese brands with OVD designations from the « Massif Central » area accounted for 65 000 metric tonnes in 1996, which made this area, with 38% of the national tonnage, the first regional area concerned with cheese OVD designations. The manufacturing development and improvement of the cheese quality with OVD designations are approached within two Research-Development hubs (Sensitive Area Hub and «Massif Central» OVD Cheesemaking Hub), of which some research examples are described in this text. As regards the link between product and native soil, there now exists objective elements which enable the showing of the effect of some prime factors on the sensuous characteristics of cheese types such as the flower diversity on grasslands for instance; others fall more under the production system such as fodder preservation method and physiological state of animals ... One has next to wonder about the technical and economical viability of these production systems. Finally, a tool for identification and analysis on milk-dedicated soils has been developed. In crossing the characteristics of physical environment and animal husbandry, it may gradually enrich the results of the previous studies. The notion of quality by the consumer has also been the subject of research work, within the scope of the RIPPLE European programme which was launched in 1997. This programme is on « regional images and the promoting of quality products and services » and aims to develop recommendations on the policies to set up in this field for the development of disadvantaged rural areas. For some years, the awareness of a necessary rationalisation for these productions and a stronger assertion of their relationship to native soil has brought hope for the future. It should enable an increased economic development while preserving their quality and their positive image. The repercussions in terms of employment and therefore of local development are factual.	cheese;research;rural areas
587	Quantification of solid transport in the Algerian Chellif watershed.  In order to permit a rapid response for the request of the engineers for the estimate of quantity of the solid transport to the exutory of a watershed, a simple and easy tool to make in work has been set up. The adopted principal based on hydrometric data of measuring stations. A seasonery and annual analysis have permitted to define an appropriate estimating method of solid bringing. The study has been bought by analysing delivered daily means, by integral floods and finely by decomposition of floods. SIDI BEL-ATAR station to the exutory of a watershed of CHELLIF has been selected as an application. The obtained results are satisfactory enough because of the fact of the correlating coefficients of the models Qs = f(Q) are between 87% and 95% . The quantity the founded suspended sediment are situated between 8 and 38 millions of tans per year, they appear huge without doubts due to the vulnerability of CHELLIF basin in a relation to its erosion and the importance of its oued CHELIFF bringing liquid and turbulent and its torrential regime.	floods;watershed
588	Quantification et maîtrise des flux de nitrates : de la parcelle drainée au bassin versant. To study the nitrate transfers through of nitrate in a context of subsurface drained plot makes it possible to highlight the main processes of leaching. The presence of the drain pipe at 1 m deep strongly modifies water and nitrates pathways. The concentrations measured at outlet of drained plot (site of Jaillière) are related to the localization of the nitrogen stock between drain and interdrain. A pluri-annual approach introduces the concept of leaching cycle whose nitrate residue management at entry-winter is a key. At watershed scale, (site of Orgeval), the comprehension of the nitrate concentrations is more complex: the interactions between groundwater, river, ripisylve are observed on various space scales. In addition to the adaptation of BMP's at plot scale, the restauration of landscape retention zones facilitates processes of nitrates elimination (benthic and riparian denitrification). Those complementary mitigating solutions make part of nitrate management within a watershed.	nitrate;nitrate concentrations;space
589	What do with biowastes: energy production or compost production? What is known about techniques for treatments and optimal valorisation of biowastes. Biowastes are organic wastes that are putrescible, liable to decay or spoil, and compose the domestic wastes. Bio-Wastes are an embarrassment when they are mixed in the domestic wastes bound to incineration or the dumps. Yet processed separately, they are able to produce biogas or compost. This use is interesting for the sustainable development. However, biowastes have to be sorted to separate the dry and wet components; and inceneration and the dumps stay the main destination of these wastes.	compost
590	"What is the limit of ""good ecological status"" for benthic invertebrates in rivers? Contribution of spatial extrapolation models linking the normalized global biological index to land use. For the implementation of the European Water Framework Directive, there is a need of pressures/impacts models allowing to set the priority actions for the restoration. We developed large scale pressures/impacts models, linking aquatic invertebrate index (IBGN) to watershed land cover. We used decision trees method to generate classifications allowing spatial extrapolation. Validated spatial extrapolation models were used to represent on a national scale the probable current ecological status of rivers based on IBGN. Urban land cover appeared as the first negative impact factor followed by agriculture (arable land); natural areas appeared as a positive factor on ecological status. We used this model to test two hypothesis for the good status boundary, and to simulate the results at the national scale. Many areas under high agricultural pressure (lowlands and Mediterranean region) are in borderline situation according to the good status hypothesis."	ecological;areas
591	What expectations from Research to intensify the efficiency of public action in low-density rural territoires ? Eleven acting people express themselves. The organisers of the first international days on research for sensitive rural territory management, (Clermont-Ferrand on 27-29th April, 1998) wished to bring together the Research circle with the circle of acting people involved in territory management in order to answer the expected « perspective » and analysis requirements for designing and preparing interventions capable of solving problems on these areas. Word was therefore given to eleven acting people who are research users involved at geographic levels ranging from local level to European level, including regional, inter-regional and national levels: councillors, administrative persons in charge, socioprofessional and associative persons in charge. The main questions were concerned with the type of contributions that research can bring and on which territorial levels the problems can be grasped and public action terms can be specified ? The type of acting people's requirements for territory management is very diverse and may require the development of very acute methods, tools and scientific deepening. However, what seems to be lacking most generally are research work and synthesis intervals. Facing scientists who declare not to always listen to demand sufficiently, and not to transfer their knowledge sufficiently, some public-decision acting people acknowledge that they have to learn how to express their requirements.	research;efficiency
592	Considerations and operational proposals about farm diagnostic assessment in the perspective of a French farm territorial contract (CTE). The French agricultural act of July 1999 established a new tool to promote the multifunctionality of agriculture and to favour the adaptation of farms to social expectations. This tool is a farm contract, called contrat territorial d'exploitation (CTE). The CTE is based upon a farm diagnostic assessment. In this paper we offer considerations about multifunctionality and farm assessment concept and we stress on the choice of indicators and references. Operational proposals are exposed to carry out a farm diagnostic assessment in the perspective of a CTE.	agricultural

Various observations on arrangements for open-air wintering of suckling heifers have highlighted useful information regarding the protection of the environment by quantifying the recoverable waste. However, the task was made more difficult by the need to protect the animals from wind and rain and to maintain ground firmness on the outskirts of the area involved.	environment
594	Which tools to construct an action plan to limit the diffuse pollution by pesticides? The Laives case study. Approached by farmers preoccupied to limit the pesticide contamination of water catchments of the city of Laives, the Chamber of Agriculture of Saône-et-Loire (France) implemented multiple approaches to evaluate the risk of diffuse pollution on this area. The study consisted in realising a diagnosis of the agricultural practices at the plot scale, completed by a diagnosis of the water flow in order to identify the field plots presenting a risk of pesticide transfer into water according to the method developed by the Corpen (the French Guidance Committee for agricultural practices respectful of the environment). Corrective solutions were also proposed on these at risk plots as recommended by the Corpen. The evolution of the practices was then assessed by calculating the IFT (an index of treatment frequency) and the I-Phy indicators on 29 field plots. The results obtained by each of these approaches are analysed and the assets and limits are discussed. The experience gained within the framework of this study is used to propose a methodology for using at best these different approaches.	agriculture;pesticide;water;environment
595	Dynamic flood retention and risk sharing. On the implementation of local compensation schemes. This article analyzes the socio-economic consequences of water storage policies, implemented by the French Flood Prevention Action Programmes (PAPI). These policies are designed to reduce flood risks at the basin level for example by reallocating risks from the most vulnerable to the least vulnerable areas, usually from urban to rural areas. Water basin managers are legally held to account for excess-damages. Since existing national indemnification schemes for natural hazards do not apply in the same way when PAPIs are implemented, farmers require that specific local compensation funds be set-up. This article summarizes the findings of an exhaustive survey of all PAPI basins in France and analyses how such compensation funds should be designed in order to ensure financial sustainability and local acceptability. It shows why the new flood management programmes may not be sustainable and it proposes alternative solutions, based on a better coordination between local water managers, insurance companies and public authorities.	water;local water;flood;france;retention;areas;local compensation
596	Update of the guide on the equivalence between landfill mineral barriers. The objective of the Equivalence Guide is to define rules of good practice with respect to equivalent solutions for landfill mineral barriers. The guide refers primarily to non-hazardous waste landfills. The guide, which was first drafted in 2002, was updated in 2008, by a working group composed of the main organisations working on landfill mineral barriers in France. The update also benefited from feedback from professional partners (consultants, landfill operators, geosynthetic suppliers...). This paper summarizes the main changes with respect to the previous version.	landfill mineral barriers
597	Agricultural redevelopment of aggregates quarries: proposals for improving their quality for sustainable agricultural use. Mineral working followed by high standard agricultural reclamation allows the conservation of the agricultural soil patrimonial resource. A revue of agricultural reclamation shows quarry operators' progresses for 20 years. Handling separately topsoil and subsoil, short soil storage and progressive reclamation are now the rule. However improvements are possible because to many reclaimed for agricultural-use parcels are leaved fallow as set-aside. Soil must imperatively be moved when enough dry to avoid its degradation. Planning permission should be flexible to not impose wet soil movements. Farmers must respect an aftercare period because the soil is fragile. It must restore its potentialities. Grassland establishment during 3-4 years (grass or legume ground cover) allows this fertility restoration.	agricultural
598	"National inventory of river and sea dykes - the state of advancement of the operation, primary results and perspectives. In 1999, the French Minister of the Environment issued a national inventory of river and sea dykes using the software database ""DYKES"". The tragic floods of September 2002 in the Gard confirmed the importance of this inventory operation which aims to evaluate the issues involving the safety of dykes protecting flooded areas. After recalling the characteristic principals of the operation, the present article outlines its state of advancement and the primary extrapolations that can be made, displaying in detail the obtained results for the river and sea dykes of the Aquitaine region and, finally, describing the perspectives for the continuation of the inventory. At the end of 2002, the inventory had been completed for four administrative regions (Alsace, Aquitaine, Haute-Normandie and Nord Pas-de-Calais). A rough extrapolation of the results allows the primary estimation of the magnitude of national park of dykes (between 7 500 and 12 000 km of work) and confirms the spectacular amount and diversity of managers, who number about a thousand. Choose for example the Aquitaine region, counting some 840 km of dykes, spread out for the most part between Garonne, Dordogne and Adour rivers, and the Estuary of Gironde. More than two thirds of these dykes raise concern, often because their real state is unknown or their management is not identifiable. A new version, accessible via the Internet, of the database DYKES has just been completed. It must allow to finish the inventory of work under the best conditions so as to indentify the dykes that need reinforcement most urgently."	floods;river
599	Landfill recirculation of leachate concentrates from evaporation treatment process. It is established that landfill leachate recirculation (i) speeds up waste biodegradation, (ii) reduces leachate pollution and (iii) increases biogas production by enhancement of waste moisture content and consecutive activated biological degradation. To evaluate the impact of leachate concentrate recirculation on leachate quantity and quality and biogas production, CReeD has conducted a laboratory study in co-operation with Cemagref. Two columns have been filled with a reconstituted typical waste; check column received only water whereas test column received water and concentrates. Present results (after 400 days of monitoring) show that methanogenesis has installed later in test column than in check column. The concentrate seems to hinder bacterial development as shown by the smaller biogas production of the test column (29% smaller than the check one in volume). The organic load of concentrate appears totally restituted. The hydric balance shows that 97% of the recirculated volumes are immediately restituted whereas restitution of the mineral load of concentrate is delayed but also nearly total (70 to 100% of restitution). The main conclusion is that concentrate recirculation has not the same beneficial effects as the leachate one. Future results of the still on-going study will allow knowing if actual trends are confirmed.	water;moisture

Spreading distribution and accuracy of the applied rate have been analysed in reference with standard test procedures. The present state of sludge application quality in France is then assessed through the results of a survey and field tests carried out during the years 2000 and 2001.	organic;france
601	Recommendations for sustainable forest management of aggregates quarries. The forestry rehabilitation of quarries allows to return the land to timber production in case of alluvial quarry, or more frequently to restore a good landscape quality by woodland plantation on working faces and slopes of pits. A synthesis of the tree needs and of the specificity of forest soils allows to reveal the reclamation's characteristics. Working faces in the Mediterranean area often offer extremely severe climatic conditions and few topsoil available for plants. Some improvements are possible: Cliff-size faces blasting to shape them to a better compatibility, to regenerate a thicker soil using settling silt and organic matter (composts) and to protect tree plants against herbaceous competition for water, to plant directly on overbunden or deads, nitrogen fixative species and mycorrhized plants. As quarry survey showed that the young plant lack of quality made the reclamation unsuccessful, we precise some improvements to ensure a better quality of the supply.	
602	Reconnaissance by close remote sensing of vineyards and analysis of their spatial structure using intra-plot frequency analysis. Application to the monitoring of the effects of cultural practices. Under mediterranean viticultural conditions, rainfall and pollutant runoff are to a large extent determined by soil surface features and field structure. Recognising these surface variables at the scale of one or more catchments is mandatory for the comprehension of flooding events, agricultural pollution, and water resource management. The approach adopted by this study is to update vineyard information over large areas on the basis of airborne remote sensing, providing high resolution data. At the end this should provide field data to spatially distributed hydrological models. Within this context, colour image mosaics have been analysed on the basis of a per-field Fourier transform. An automatic analysis provides land cover, training mode (wire-trained/goblet) and geometry of vine rows (spacing, orientation and cover). The accurate and reproducible data enrich the field database. The method seems (i) transposable to other regions and other discontinuous crops, and (ii) an encouraging perspective for the study of other hydrologically interesting parameters (agricultural practises, weed cover...).	agricultural;water;vineyard;flooding
603	Reduction of located water pollution by agricultural phytosanitary products. First lessons from a survey of European professionals. This paper deals with the results of the Life-Environment TOPPS project for the point-source pollution control with Plant Protection Products (PPP). At the European scale (600 questionnaires diffused and analysed) it describes the awareness of the stakeholders involved in the agricultural practices and discuss the practical solutions to avoid point-source pollution. A majority of theses stakeholders perceive it as the most significant pattern of water contamination by the PPP. Reducing these pollutions is based on a better knowledge of the possible solutions and practices to improve the situation. This includes training, demonstration and all other means to diffuse information. In addition, incentives or enforced regulations are mentioned. During PPP manipulation, three technical processes are identified as very efficient to minimise the impacts on the environment: after spraying (tank rinsing and sprayer external cleaning), before spraying (spray liquid preparation, sprayer filling) and the waste management (empty containers). Thus, the equipments to avoid spilling, reducing residual volume, rinsing, and more widely the sprayer inspection are to promote including cost overruns, the technical reliability and the acceptably accurate solution to this problem by the farmers. In terms of infrastructure, the development of filling and cleaning areas and the implementation of a recovery system of empty pesticide containers are the priorities.	environment;pesticide;water;agricultural
604	Reducing flood transfer in highly drained agricultural watersheds: state of knowledge and research. During most common rainfall events (one to five years return period), subsurface drainage increases the soil infiltration capacity. Consequently field-scale peakflow rates are generally lower than were surface runoff peakflow rates before drainage construction. However flood routing may be enhanced by arterial drainage ditches, often over-sized due to collector drain depths. This enhancement could be mitigated by letting the network overflow in its less critical zones, which could be achieved through reduced cross sections such as road crossovers. This solution applied to rivers is referred to as dynamic flood control. This paper presents some consequences of this principle applied to an arterial drainage network and brings design hints. In order to describe flow transfer through a small agricultural catchment (a few sq. km), a hydraulic model based on Saint-Venant equations was applied to an experimental catchment (Orgeval experimental catchment, Seine-et-Marne). The model was used to test additional storage places with a same mitigation objective. Adding reduced cross sections brought a gain in flood storage capacity until an upper number. Dispatched storage places appeared also more efficient than a single reservoir located downstream. Associated culverts, with two different diameters, also appear to control a larger range of events than a single reduced cross section. As a counterpart to these flood control measures, a complex modification is induced at subsurface drainage outlets. An additional peakflow rate mitigation within collector drains networks can be observed, but it means a reduced efficiency for field subsurface drainage. This paper presents a recently built physical model which begins to give results, and will help to explain this interaction, and to design flood mitigation measures with a better adequacy.	flood;agricultural;flood storage;drainage;flood control
605	Consideration of the quality parameters required for purification plant discharges. On the basis of the relations linking the different chemical parameters of the treated wastewater a discussion is produced in the view of laying down the local discharge consent standards. The key parameters (BOD, ammonificable nitrogen...) to determine the others are proposed. It is discussed that some of the quality parameters (COD...) should not be uselessly fixed at stringent values. The best qualities that the present processes (entended aeration AS, BAFS; sand infiltration) without expensive complementary stages can produce an established. Some other considerations try to turn richer the discussion.	
606	"2003 reform of the Common Agricultural Policy: first effects on field crop farms in the Provence Alpes Côte d'Azur region.  The Common Agricultural Policy reform (CAP) of June 2003 has changed the way the European Union supports its farm sector. The vast majority of subsidies are now paid independently from the volume of production as a single farm payment (decoupling), the payment is linked to the respect of the rules of the "" cross-compliance "" and the rural development policy is reinforced. The paper presents the results of a study carried out in 2006 and 2007, which analyzes the evolution of the strategies of farmers (in farms cultivating arable crops) to adapt their farm to this reform, in three main domains : land use, practises changing and evolution of sources of income. The study is based on an enquiry among farmers in three areas of the region "" Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur "" (in south of France): "" dry "" agriculture, irrigated agriculture and periurban agriculture. The study shows that the CAP reform has a direct effect on the choice of crops but his effect is less clear in the other domains and can be considered as one of the various factors influencing the strategies of farmers."	agricultural;farmers;evolution
607	Views of local authorities on the objectives and the setting up of the Plans for the Prevention of natural Risks (PPR). Implementation of the Natural-Risks Prevention Plans (PPR), established by the Barnier law in 1995, was due to the relative failure of the Risk-Exposition Plans. The new plans were intended, in particular, to clarify and redefine the means and the roles of the State and townships, improve collaboration as well as streamline and accelerate the procedure. Currently, the experience gained is not yet sufficient to access the procedure in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. However, to ensure the best possible level of mutual awareness and knowledge between the partners involved in procedures, it rapidly became clear that there was a need to study the reactions of local government entities to the PPR, to their goals and their implementation. That work was carried out by polling some ten townships in two departments, each involved at different stages of the procedure.	ppr
608	Regulations applicable to the various river dykes. In the dictionary, dyke means a long construction built to contain water. The difficulty of this article lies in the fact that the definiton includes different kinds of construction with different aims and regulations. But, they are all embankments under the naturel ground with potential stakes of security. Because of this diversity, one presentation can't describe all the applicable regulations. For some construction, the regulation of security control is handled in special articles of this seminar. So, this article is bounded to a rapid presentation of different kinds of dyke and their regulation in introduction, to develop specially the regulation of flood protection dykes for which an extra control has been recently settled.	
609	Aquatic plants control. One of the main problems for aquatic environmental management is linked to the excessive important development of some aquatic plants. These plants can be native species favoured by environmental disturbances created by human activities, or exotic ones able to adapt to a large range of sites. Their spreading out in aquatic environments is often requiring a control management. These prolific growths are mainly concerning lakes and wetlands. Some examples from diverse sites are showing their diversity and the needs of adapting control methods to the characteristics of these species, of water-bodies and human activities of these sites. To complete the essential steps of preventive management, allowing to reduce the control activities on aquatic plants to what is just necessary, efforts must be carried on to improve these practices. They should especially insist on the assessment of methods impacts, on a best co-ordination of undertaken actions, on a best circulation of information between all the partners, and on a intensification of a training program of all these actors of aquatic plants regulation practices.	aquatic environmental management
610	Regulation and Amenities: Results of a Modelling Approach. This paper shows the strenghts of a modelling approach for the designing of institutional strategies that would support the promotion of regional goods and service, via the creation or the save of specific territorial attribust. After the specification of the methodology used to address this question, the paper gives an example of application of this methodology. This example shows the way by which the construction of an explanatory model of the behaviour of consumers contributes to the creation of new knowledge about the possible impacts of the environmental and cultural features of a given region, of the local production methods, of the landscapes and of the related quality signs, on the behaviour of consumers in face to regional quality products. It also shows how such a modelling approach facilitates the discussion of the results of a research project and contributes to the knowledge dissemination. These results are part of an EU funded project (RIPPLE FAIR-CT96-1827).	
611	Relationship between mass flow and input torque of fertiliser broadcaster spreading disc: modelling and experimental validation. The aim of this work is to show that the driving torque of the spreading disc on a centrifugal broadcaster can be used as a fertiliser mass flow estimator. This flow estimation depends on physical properties of fertiliser and motion parameters on the spinning disc. Our study deals with the characterisation and the simulation of the resisting torque exerted by the fertiliser on the vanes. Several parameters are taken into account : location of the feeding point, speed of rotation, fertiliser features, disc shape, length and pitch angle of the vanes. Our model is validated by comparing calculated and measured values. Used on centrifugal spreaders, this mass flow estimation method can replace hopper weighing devices with some technical advantages (lower sensibility to accelerations, mass flow control on each spinning disc,...). As part of precision farming and site specific fertilisation, the use of the previous method allows efficient real-time servo control system for the management of the fertiliser flow.	
612	Linking environment and forest trees production: a comparison of two approaches. Two methods of studying forest species site-yield relationships have been tested by the Cemagref forestry division, Nogent-sur-Vernisson (France) and are presented, illustrated and compared. One method concerns the relationships between forest site type and yield, the other the autecologic approach. These methods can be applied in monospecific, even-aged and closed stands. In the first case, the site description is synthetic and corresponds to a forest site typology. In the second case, site description is analytic, so the site is described by different ecological parameters. The wood yield of the stand is characterised by a site index - top height at a given age - determined using a top height growth model. The comparison between the two approaches shows that both give useful results, with the same level of accuracy. The autecologic approach proves however to be the quickest and cheapest method.	environment;forestry
613	Response of the Brest bay towards the increase of nutrients imputs. In order to analyse the response of phytoplankton stocks to increasing enrichment in the bay of Brest, a survey of the cycle of nutrients and chlorophyll concentrations has been performed in 1993 and compared to earlier measurement. With regards to the seventies, a two-fold nitrate loading is now entering this ecosystem. As a result of these anthropogenic modifications, Si/N ratios have decreased but phytoplankton stocks have not increased. Both data analysis and ecological modelling show that several non anthropogenic factors have hindered the emergence of eutrophication effects in spite of increasing nitrate loading.	brest bay;bay of brest
614	 Extensive drainage network (RHE) built from the Carthage database. The environmental characteristics of continental aquatic ecosystems are largely inherited along the drainage network. Their automated estimation requires the use of a digital drainage network of connected linear features. The network currently available in France (drain principal naturel) allowed several applications including the modeling of the natural flow, classification of river types and application of ecological models at the national level. However, this network is limited because of its lack of representativeness of headwater basins and small rivers. In order to provide a more comprehensive coverage of small rivers we present an extensive drainage network (RHE) that supplements the existing network. The RHE contains 2.5 times more arcs that the natural main drain, and provides a better representation of headwater basins (small rivers, short distances to the source, steep slopes).	drainage
615	Feedback on the removal of the Kernansquillec dam. Kernansquillec dam in French Britany has been demolished in 1996. It was a multiple arch dam, 75-year-old, 15 m high , with a reservoir capacity of 400 000 m3. Due to the poor condition of the dam, risks involved downstream, and lack of an operator after the end of the concession, the Prefet decided the dam demolition. Management of the sediments, representing 50% of the reservoir capacity was achieved without interrupting water intakes for domestic water supply and fishfarming, situated few hundred meters downstream from the dam. The solution combined: hydrodredging of 90 000 m3 of sediments to restore the old river bed in the reservoir; in situ consolidation of the rest of the sediments, by slowly lowering the reservoir water level; construction of four little rockfill weirs downstream from the dam, for water decantation at the end of emptying. Total cost of the operation was just over 1 MA, including 0,6 MA for sediment management.	water;demolition;sediments
616	Rheology of sludge from purification plants: preliminary studies for controlling storage and spreading. Soft residual sewage sludge behaves in a complex way. It is too liquid to form into a heap but too solid to be spread properly using current machinery. A study of the mechanical behaviour of this sludge has been undertaken recently to remove these two major obstacles to agricultural recycling, other than various psychological reservations. After a preliminary description of sewerage treatment processes, we have attempted to highlight the characteristics considered to be the most relevant. Parallels are drawn with other materials in several fields, bearing in mind the specific characteristics of sludge. Finally, in order to finalise our experimental approach, we illustrate our proposal with a specific case.	sludge;recycling
617	Wealth, diversity and challenges of river landscapes. In France, over half of the territorial communities border a river. Up to the end of the 19th century, the French landscape was built around these water streams which were perfect spots to develop a number of activities. Starting at the end of the first world war, almost all traditional uses disappeared, or receded, and men started to integrate rivers as elements of land development. Water was collected depending on the needs, and then thrown back without any particular care. Today, water appears as an essential and endangered raw material, and rivers are more and more perceived as essential components of the landscape and of our heritage. The economic necessity, the social demand, the ecological needs make it necessary to monitor as accurately as possible aquatic systems. This awareness comes along with several national and regional regulations. In front of these new development problems, landscape specialists are more and more on the font line, especially in urban and periurban environments. This article explains how important it is, in this field, to work in terms of « goals », to adjust the actions and landscape recommendations to these goals, and to use a work scale adopted by enforcing a number of methodological principles and requirements. It explains the need to involve all actors interested in rivers and shows the importance of identifying « landscape ambience units » which, because of their characteristics, generate specific modes of intervention that belong to the field of ecological engineering.	water;france;wealth
618	Flood risk: a complex probabilistic notion for citizens. Floods and inundations are hazardous phenomena that make difficult decisions and communication towards citizens. The stochastic description of the river behaviour is difficult to explain, even sometimes for experts. At the end, people usually misunderstand the flood risk notions. Meanwhile, clear messages are necessary due to social and economic stakes. We try to identify some obstacles to objective flood risk perception and we propose some ways to build a representation of hazardous phenomena. We propose a formalisation through the image of coloured balls, function of floods probabilities.	flood;flood risk
619	Natural risks and cartographic transcription. It is admitted that a map is the object which gives the best and most certain information on the « risk situations » of a given part of the territory, for all types of natural risk. Much work in this area has given rise to many achievements, of which some are of high quality. A global analysis of the field shows, not surprisingly, that it is the quality of the prior design methodology (which maps, for which action and for what public ?) which decides the quality of the map, which must choose, for example, between the functions of information, interdiction and/or regulatory zoning. It would seem that a canonical map does not exist, and that the really effective summary maps are based on an excellent knowledge of both hazards and vulnerability, at the « right » scale of work, depending on the objective desired. Much remains to be done in this field where the standardisation of powerful cartographic tools (such as GIS) cannot replace or simply hide the need for methods of risk management which will generate effective maps. Any belief of the contrary would be an illusion.	natural
620	Environmental role and cartographic identification of waterlogged soils of bottom lands. Environmental role of waterlogged areas of bottom land is related to three processes: interception of run-off waters contaminated by pesticides, heavy metals and suspended matter, adsorption on soil components of some of these pollutants and denitrification. In intensive farming zones, these waterlogged areas of bottom land do not play any longer their environmental functions. On the contrary, they can be a source of environmental risk for the channel network. Consequently, an important part of agro-environmental policy concerns these waterlogged areas of bottom land whose extent is about 20% of Brittany territory. The first step of agro-environmental policy is the cartographic identification of these areas. In this project, the cartographic identification has been performed using Digital Elevation Models. A 20m grid DEM produced by stereo-restitution of SPOT images was used. A topographic index derived from Beven-Kirkby index was used to identify these waterlogged areas of bottom land. Drainage network was also modelised with use of DEM. Watersheds boundaries, sub-watersheds boundaries and sloppy areas were also produced with DEM modeling.	waters
621	Monitoring and indicators of forest biodiversity. Forests make an original and irreplaceable contribution to global biodiversity. It is not spared by the global erosion of biodiversity. Many public policies aim to reduce or even halt this erosion; they use monitoring and indicators as an evaluation tool. After presenting the issues at stake for biodiversity in French metropolitan forests, the authors of this note examine the existing systems, their strengths and weaknesses, and then propose improvements. In particular, they emphasise the value of direct monitoring of species or populations to define biodiversity status indicators. Such monitoring of species and populations is essential to test the validity of pressure indicators and the effectiveness of forest conservation policies and practices.	populations;biodiversity;forests
622	Agricultural runoff: identifying flexibility by modeling production practices. To guide research on methods for reducing erosive surface runoff, while avoiding unfeasible solutions, it was of interest to assess how much leeway farmers have in this regard. The study was conducted in the Caux area (Seine-Maritime, France), which is susceptible to surface runoff and erosion. We investigated the possibility of moving crop rotations around the farm to avoid growing crops most susceptible to runoff at the uphill end. We also assessed the possibility of introducing new options that reduce surface runoff into the farming calendar. These questions were first dealt with in separate fields using a rotation decision model, and then a work-planning decision model was used to assess the farm as a whole. We showed for a stylised case that farmers have not much leeway for rotation-blocks modifications. The work-planning model indicates that it should be possible to introduce an intermediate crop, but only on one-sixth of the overall area. The ultimate solutions should involve cultivation procedures that do not disrupt the farmer's work-planning model, and operational strategies that make runoff control compatible with productive farming. Research to this end is currently under way.	agricultural;france
623	Dam break: validation of Cemagref's numerical models within the framework of CADAM. CADAM (Concerted Action for Dam Break Waves) was funded by European Union in order to compare the numerical methods used to simulate the breaching of a dam and the downstream propagation of the wave created. The methodology used during the Concerted Action is summed up and the results obtained by Cemagref are presented on some specific case studies representative of the set of tests used. For the propagation wave, references may be analytical solutions, experiments or field observations. Only for the first case, it can be considered that numerical solution is close to the reference. For experiments and field cases, the physical processes show instabilities linked with the high turbulence of the flow which are not correctly described by the de Saint Venant equations. However, with convenient calibration of the Manning-Strickler coefficient, the calculation results are, in average, in agreement with observations; 2D models can more easily take into account local conditions. For breaching of a dam, only experimental data were available; the calculation results were very scattered and the more complex codes did not provide better results than the simpler models in all cases.	
624	Knowledge and expertising for local policy-making: an application to natural hazards. The objective of this empirical work has been a better understanding of the elaboration, the appropriation and the uses of knowledge for local policy-making with a particular glance at the experts and expertising in these processes. It has dealt with the case of natural hazards. Knowledge feeds a social elaborated and shared representation of the hazards which appears as the core of the action. The rationalist approaches which envelop public life lead to a scientific and technical legitimacy. In this context, resorting to expertising is inevitable. Information, expertising conclusions are widely distributed, but public debates lack. Expertising is submitted to many tensions. The more accurate come from the ambiguous place of the experts between the scientific and technical pool and the decision-making pool. They aren't independant from the local community but though, they don't coordinate enough. They work a lot for a good diffusion and appropriation of the information. All these exchanges around knowledge give the opportunity of collective learning and matching, which allow to measure the existing forces and to raise the confidence of the public. At the end, suggestions for a better link between knowledge and policy-making are exposed.	natural
625	Drought and irrigation water demand: elements for thought. This article reviews what is currently known in the field of water consumption for irrigation in France, which varies drastically in time and space. During the last ten years, irrigated surfaces have increased significantly, with some variations depending on the regions, in spite of the CAP reform. With 43% of irrigated area, corn remains the main irrigated crop. The knowledge of irrigated surfaces, satisfying from a statistical standpoint, remains inadequate to quantitatively estimate water samplings for irrigation, because of the important variability of the crops water requirement and of the limited knowledge of irrigation practices. The Cemagref has developed, at regional scale, a method for estimating the supply in irrigation water during a severe drought. The theoretical water requirements of corn, chosen as a reference crop, are assessed for the main production regions, using climatic data and soil characteristics, and by taking into account restriction practices by farmers during a lasting drought. On the basis of this work, it is possible to propose a system of monitoring and prediction analysis of water demand from farmers on a regional scale, in order to better assess the risks of inadequation between supply and demand - and therefore of conflicts between users -, and to set up more efficient management modes. This system will rely, among others, on a better understanding of the farmers' practices.	water;irrigation water;irrigation;drought;farmers
626	Safety of dykes and dams. This paper describes two actions, asked by the French Ministry for the Environment and carried out by Cemagref, whose common objective is the safety of hydraulic works, presenting high hazards in case of rupture. Concerning dams, a national investigation, leaded from 1990 to 1994, revealed some lacks in the monitoring (by the owner) and in the control (by the Water Policy Authority) of dams under the Ministry's authority. So, Cemagref was asked to contribute to the reinforcement of a comprehensive plan based on training of engineers, appraisal of dams at the time of decenial visit and development of date bases to gather available information. Levees for flood protection are, as for their safety, at the crossing of a technological hazard (rupture) and a natural hazard (inundation). To get a better knowledge of those works, Cemagref was asked to build an inquiry from dealing with levees, owners and protected eras. This inquiring was, in a first step, tested locally with a paper form. Based on the return of experience, a soft ware was developed for the national inquiry and data exploitation.	environment
627	Sensitivity of flood damage assessment based on building vulnerability characterization. This paper compares, in a local scale, four different methods to assess buildings vulnerability to floods. In urban areas, buildings and contents represent the majority of flood damages. The four methods are different in relation to the quality of the data used. Each method is analyzed in terms of its feasibility and the reliability of the loss evaluation. The municipal of Holtzheim, in the Bruche River (Bas-Rhin, Alsace, France) is studied. We test the sensitivity of the evaluation results to the four different methods used to assess vulnerability. Loss is evaluated in the range of 245 to 705 k€ per year when using the most feasible method. When using the most reliable method, we evaluate loss in the range of 315 to 405 k€  per year. In conclusion, we discuss the choice between the different methods to assess vulnerability and a recommendation guide is proposed.	flood;urban areas
628	SHYREG: a methodology for a regional assessment of flood discharge. Application in the French mediterranean area. SHYREG is a method developed for the regional knowledge of the flood discharges over different durations and for different return periods. The methodology consists of a hourly rainfall generator associated with a simple rainfall - runoff modelisation. It enables the simulation of long-term discharge data sets. Frequency distribution are drawn from these simulated series, thus allowing the evaluation of the discharge quantiles. This information is mapped with a resolution of 1 km2. The estimation of the discharge quantiles for a river basin requires to synthesise this continuous information. This led us to introduce the concept of a Statistical Transfer Function (FTS : Fonction de Transfert Statistique). It is then possible to give an estimation of the reference flood discharges in any point of the hydrographic network of the studied area. On the French Mediterranean Area, this regional methodology is based upon more than 500 raingauges and 220 watersheds. It leads to a good restitution of the discharge quantiles estimated from the observed series for return periods ranging between 2 and 100 years.	flood

The will to construct an environment-friendly and planned muck spreading option made come out, as well to the Ministry of Agriculture and of Environment as to the Chambers of agriculture, and to other actors like the Water Agencies and the ""ADEME"", the need of a computerized system for the monitoring of the manure spreading. Cemagref is the owner of the Sigemo - Computerized System for the management of the spreading of organic matters. In the field of manure spreading, the job and institutions constraints are very strong. Cemagref has set up methodology of work which is original and suitable to the context, particularly, with a number partnerships. A national architecture based on open and communication technologies, its foundation around a common language are the main results of this approach."	agriculture;environment
630	Glass eel migration simulator in the Gironde estuary. The migration of eel elvers in the estuary is on the ground as well as using an individual-centred model. The migration simulator created is based on the coupling between a spatiotemporal discretisation of the characteristics of the environment and the individual behaviour of a population of elvers during migration. The model is mainly calibrated by qualitative comparison with abundance indices derived from daily declarations made by professional fishermen. The model provided information on migration and the influence of temperature on the transit time in the estuary.	environment;glass
631	Simulation of the hydrological functioning of a watershed: application to the design and management of a dam. The hydrological model presented here is used to simulate the continuous operation of a dam, by generating flow data over a long period (1,000 years for example). This enables water volumes to be assessed as well as flood management. The generation of continuous real time information has two main advantages. Firstly, different dam management rules can be tested. Secondly, breakdowns can be analysed, after the event, by statistical processing of scenarios. The flood simulation is not a single event reduced to an artificial form: a series of floods, that build up behind the dam, are available to the designer to test the operation of the sluices and to carry out a statistical study of the flow leaving the dam. The method is based on two random rainfall generator models. Daily rainfall is generated continuously. The hourly rainfall generator model is activated when daily rainfall exceeds 20 mm. These models are linked to a model that converts rainfall into flow normally calculated on a daily basis but switching to an hourly basis during flooding. This paper presents the method and the various models used and also describes some examples.	flood;water
632	Multi-agent simulation for watershed water resource management. In France, the use of the water resource is governed by European directives and national regulations. The application of these regulations is delegated to regional and local authorities for each catchment area. These fairly explicit rules result from negotiations between the different participants concerned, whose interests are essentially divergent. These negotiations very often take place without consideration of the consequences of the adoption of the rules, either at the global or individual level. Emphasising the agricultural dimension of the problem, the objective of the simulator presented here is to provide a way of testing the rules for sharing the water resources for the concrete case of an Authorised Syndicated Association (ASA) partly responsible for the management of the basin. By studying the concrete case of the management of the river Lère, we have tested the adequacy of the BDI (Beliefs, Desires, Intentions) formalism for representing the players concerned.	water;agricultural;watershed water
633	"Specific features and development problems in low-density areas. The purpose of this account is to perform an inventory of the main characteristics of ""low human-density"" areas, to identify their modification tendencies and to discover the actions capable of stabilising them, perhaps even to help their development. These land expanses cover an important surface area from the European territory. Their faintest settlement has been the fruit of history and today, in many instances, these areas are somewhat economically and socially behind. Some ""chief characteristics"" have been singled out, but reality is a lot more complex, and moreover extremely diverse: there exists territories in real decline, some others are stabilising and there are also some which are undergoing a full revival. After a proposal for numerical definition of low-density territories, a quick analysis at European level shows that a major part of western Europe belongs to the range of the low-density ones, and it is observed, for that matter, that middle-range mountains, despite exceptions, hold a chief situation in it. More than other areas, low-density areas see their future linked to a voluntaristic development policy. Employment is at the heart of the question. The hope to keep or to entice men implies the capability to offer them a job and a means of living, in combining farming activities, tourism, small industries ..., without neglecting the quality of the living environment, and in particular, the quality of landscapes often mentioned as an asset in favour of the countryside. Numerous examples show an inequality, according to places, historical ""legacies"" and instability of undertaken socio-economic orientations, having marked differences in efficiency observed for that matter according to countries and territories themselves."	efficiency;europe
634	Optical spectroscopy for assessing the physiological status of plants: some examples. A miniature system of near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was developed by Cemagref for measuring the maturity of fruits in the field, shaped as a glove. It could be shown that some spectral bands were more sensitive than others to the variation of temperature of the fruit. For making the calibration more robust, it proved to be helpful, said in mathematical terms, to process spectral data in an orthogonal way to the sub-space of the sensitive spectral bands. Beyond this example, Cemagref evaluates the potential of SPIR technology to assess some plant physiological parameters, especially their hydric status. First results obtained with grapevine confirm bibliographic data and suggest that this application is feasible.	mathematical
635	Large drinking water storages with PVC geomembrane and floating cover: experience and long term performance in Corsica. To face the estival tourist multitude in Corsica, it is necessary to store drinking water in great quantity during more than 6 months and this on the level of communes whose financial capacities are reduced. Original and economic techniques presented here were developed by the OEHC. The communication presents the technological developments and the reduction of the costs, thanks to the use of géomembranes and floating covers able to store and protect water during more than 6 months without giving taste to water. The results on the long-term evolution of the floating PVC covers are given. This type of solution returns ten times less expansive than a of the same tank capacity with bottom in géomembrane and concrete cover.	water;drinking water
636	Farmers' commercial strategies in a peri-urban context: the place of direct sellings - Case of the Pays d'Aix agglomeration community (Bouches-du-Rhône). In connection with the urban development, the farms can adapt themselves to the particular conditions of periurban areas by the means of direct selling. The study carried out near the city of Aix en Provence, in the south of France, shows that the commercialisation strategies linked with the territory are mainly encontered in the vegetables and wine sectors. In the vegetables case, selling on the producers markets is often practised by little farms. Direct selling to supermarkets and hypermarkets can also be observed. For wine, direct selling is mainly developed by the more dynamic firms, and in particular selling at farm.	urban;supermarkets;farmers
637	Strategies for the collective treatment of wastewater and sewage sludge: overview and trends for municipalities in the Puy-de-Dôme department. Based on a mail and phone inquiry with 471 municipalities (Communes) of Puy-de-Dôme (France), the study processes strategies of the municipalities for the management of waste water and sewage sludge. The study shows that collective treatment of water and sewage sludge concerns more of ¾ municipalities of Puy-de-Dôme. Between 1993 and 2003, the number of water-treatment plants has doubled to reach 450 units of treatment of the domestic effluents. This recent evolution concerns rather small municipalities, biggest municipalities having set up the collective purification from the seventies. Water purification produces in counterpart sewage sludge, which local volume in 2003 reaches 10 000 tons of dry materials, included liming. The modes of collective treatment of waste water become more and more conditioned by the future of sewage sludge.	water;sludge;waste water;wastewater
638	Artificial substrates: to what extent can they be used to describe diatomic assemblages in watercourses?. Diatoms are unicellular algae capable of settling on various substrates, from rocks and pebbles to sand/mud bottoms or plants. Routine samplings of diatom communities on hard surfaces are recommended and we investigated in this study whether diatom communities settlement is affected by differences between sampling substrates (natural vs. artificial). Although differences between diatom assemblages were observed, depending on intrinsic characteristics of the substrates and on their immersion duration, values for the diatom-based index were comparable for most of the substrates. However, we recommend collecting at the same time samples from naturally available hard surfaces and from artificial substrates, in order to get the most complete environmental information.	algae;artificial
639	How emerging trees can be used for a passive restoration of the stream banks at Vallée-Aux-Berges (Normandy, France). Riparian ecosystems are complex and sensitive. The restoration of these ecotones can be done in particular by the reforestation to prevent from the erosion. The aim of this study hold on the ecological restoration of a headwater stream in Normandy, France : we studied the natural reforestation of the banks by a passive restoration method. Our results show a rapid recruitment of young shrubs and trees the first year and a stabilization after one year. An increase of specie richness and of the species distribution heterogeneity is notice on all the area. Furthermore, downstream meadows are more diversify than those upstream. This study brings to light the ecological efficiency of passive restoration and its potential for riparian reforestation.	trees;natural reforestation
640	Pesticides monitoring in Brest bay. Brest Bay Contract's main objective : achieving restoration, management and protection of the environmental quality of Brest bay and its waterheds. Some objectives are : - ensure environmental monitoring : follow-up changes in environmental states, identify sensitive areas, reinforce monitoring networks. · ensure monitoring of the effects of environmental policies or programmes : monitoring and measuring the relevance of actions and programmes undertaken within the Bay contract framework. In Britanny, the nitrate and pesticide content in surface and underground waters has constantly increased over the past fifteen years. The Brest bay catchment area is a very agricultural region with particulary an intensive corn agriculture. Large amounts of herbicides are applied, atrazine is the main one. The analysis of pesticides in Brest Bay show that even at high salinity the pesticides are present. Desethylatrazine (DEA) and desisopropylatrazine (DIA), atrazine degradation products, are also present and the ratio between atrazine DEA ou DIA is much more important in May, that represent the back-ground of atrazine from the year before. In the same time other pesticides also arrive to Brest Bay (metolachlor, alachlor, diuron, isoproturon.).	pesticides;atrazine
641	Monitoring of agri-environmental operations: effects on the environment and farms. Agri-environmental schemes aim at preserve or produce environmental goods so to encourage environmental amenities linked with agriculture. This paper is based on the notion of configuration of agri-environmental schemes, built as a function of their making and implementation. It offers a grid for analysing and interpreting the issues of the monitoring of five French programs located in mountain or land-abandoned areas (in Ariège, Lozère, south of Jura, Ecrins National Park and Var forests). The analysis of the effects on the environment and farms shows the interest of schemes mixing several configurations.	environment;agriculture
642	Monitoring the transfer of phytosanitary products on watersheds and example of global modeling. This article provides information on pesticide transfer in three watersheds of 4 to 12 km² in France. It shows that the maximum concentrations are often related to the first main rainfall events occurring after the application and that they can vary from year to year. The amount of pesticide measured at the outlet was less than 1% of the application. The GLEAMS (Ground water Loading Effects of Agricultural Management Systems) model was applied to simulate pesticide mobility on small watersheds. The results show that this kind of model can't predict accurate concentrations but could be used as a screening model to classify pesticide according to their mobility in runoff, for given scenarios. A particular attention should be given to the selection of the sensitive parameters.	pesticide
643	Monitoring the effects of production control on farms and territories - Administrative data, management tools?. The evolutions of the common agricultural policy have created tools used for the control of animal productions such as « rights to produce » (dairy quotas) or « rights to bonus » (PMTVA, PCO...). The « administrative » management of these rights makes them a tool for a policy of agricultural orientation and management, which is under the responsibility of the « Commission départementale d'orientation de l'agriculture (CDOA) ». This article describes the methological study undertaken in the Massif central by the CNASEA together with the Cemagref, as well as the ADASEA and the DDAF of three test departments (Aveyron, Cantal, Creuse). The goal was to come up with recommendations to use at best the department administrative data, to analyze them together with other sources of statistical information, and thus create a system of management aid. The manual of recommendations published in the summer of 1997 concerns: the creation of a departmental database, its use for analysis. This use is described in terms of global description of agriculture, of monitoring table for the management of right flows, of analysis by production systems, and of land analysis. The article presents some key technical elements such as principal and constraints of the creation of a database, interest and ambiguity of a computation of equivalence between productions, and the various mapping approaches. It then informs on the real consequences in the three key depatments and on an additional ongoing study. Finally, perspectives are drawn: evolution of the political and regulation context which gives even more importance to this methodological study, evolution of the computer system in the DDAF which should raise some of the constraints. The optimal use of administrative data, in spite of their limitations, offers a potential of very interesting management aid, albeit very costly in terms of time, thus the need to think about the organization of this management and about human ressources that must be dedicated to it.	agricultural;evolution

Work undertaken by Cemagref in cooperation with ITPT has lead to the validation of an experimental classification method based on the potatoes appearance. This method based on two colour component analyses which performs a classification function related to tuber brightness and blemishes. The software developed in this project has allowed us to validate the method against human expertise, with a 80 % success rate.	potatoes;exercise
645	Geographic information systems and models to determine the non-point pollution hazard in a river basin. A method of analysis of non point pollution risks for a watershed unit is developed with a GIS and a model. The basis hypothesis is to consider nitrogenous plot profiles in autumn as the nitrate leaching risk index. They result of the pollutant pressure involved by agricultural practices and they induce a variable intensity pollution according to land sensibility. The parameters which are to be used in the risk index have been determined with a data analysis (follow-up of agricultural practices). The approch is first developed at field scale, and then on the watershed unit.	agricultural;geographic;model
646	Report card, a tool for monitoring migratory fish: concept and reflection on the choice of indicators for the Allis shad population in the Gironde-Garonne-Dordogne catchment area. Report card is a tool commonly used in many branches of industry, but its basic principle is often misunderstood. Its application in the case of concerted management for migratory fishes resources requires to be reviewed.Analysis of existing report card highlight that report card is a decision-support tool arranged in a set of indicators informing the pilot of a system about the state of this system and enabling him to act in order to achieve its objectives. Using the example of a report card dedicated to the Allis shad population of the Gironde Garonne Dordogne watershed, we present how such a tool can be set up and which are the external elements required (the pilot, the system, the management targets, the knowledge database). Then we precisely detailed the pahse of building and selection of the relevant indicators. The choice of the indicators is a keystone of the report card. and identified the essential. This step was organized by generating potential indicators, determining the selection criteria, then selecting the relevant indicators. These indicators are noted, classified, presented and interpreted in a table which allow to easily identify the problems on the various levels of aggregation, and to assess the gap between the result of the report card and the targets of the pilot. A first version of the Allis shad report card was built in the framework of a concerted though between scientists. After a step of scientific validation (in progress), this version will be transferred to the CO.GE.PO.MI. of the Gironde watershed for a test phase which alos aims to strengthen the social appropriation of this decision-support tool..	migratory fish;pilot;population
647	Techniques for assessing the ecotoxicity of xenobiotic substances to soil microflora. Because soil micro-organisms are mainly responsible for nutrient cycling they play a major role in plant nutrition and soil fertility. Soil is also the ultimate receptacle of a number of xenobiotic compounds and their degradation products which represent a potential threat due to their ecotoxicological impact. Soil micro-organisms are directly exposed. A desirable evolution towards sustainable agriculture requires taking into account these potentially damaging consequences. There are currently two main ways of monitoring side-effects of xenobiotic compounds on the soil microflora. For decades, size and activity descriptors of soil microbial communities were used. They have been criticised on the ground that they are the net outcome of complex physiological and structural rearrangements of the soil microflora and, for that reason, lack the necessary sensitivity. Recent progress in analysis of microbial diversity at the species, metabolic, physiological, and genetic levels offers new promising alternatives. Yet, some limitations in acquisition and interpretation of data are presented and discussed.	evolution;agriculture
648	Remote sensing and estimation of wheat yields in Europe. Within the framework of its agricultural policy, the European Commission must be able to make precise, reliable and independent predictions of regional crop yield prior to harvest. Improvements in yield prediction could be obtained by combining qualitative information provided by satellite-based sensors to the quantitative information given by crop growth models. A study was conducted over a five year period (1990-1994) using wheat, Triticum aestivum, in six regions of the European Union. Agrometeorological and meteorological data were extracted from the WOFOST, which is currently used within the European Union to predict crop biomass. A new procedure was developed (the 3M procedure) based on the Monteith formalism which defines the production of dry matter based on global radiation and variables obtained from satellites: a vegetation index (NDVI) and a stress index (CWSI). It was shown that the 3M procedure was more successful than the WOFOST procedure for predicting biomass and crop yield at a regional level.	agricultural;european commission;europe;european union

This study concerns a rehabilitation project on traditional irrigation systems located various altitudes in the Ecuadorian Andes. The use of SPOT satellite imagery combined with a digital elevation model is proved to be able to improve the assesment and characterisation of irrigation systems in mountainous regions, by providing maps of irrigation infrastructure and of land use. Possibilities of transfering the developped methods to mountainous regions of the Mediterranean area are also mentioned.	irrigation;satellite
650	TERRIT'EAU, a framework and tools for improving the agricultural landscape management facing to the preservation of water quality. Territ'eau is a framework and tools for the engineers involved in the rural development to allow them to take into account agricultural practices, landuse and landscape management of the rural areas in a water quality perspective. It is adapted for few km 2 catchment sizes. It aims to pass from results of research to operational and scientifically based tools usable to provide a functional and comprehensive assessment of agricultural catchment, and so, to increase participative approaches based on a common understanding of them. These tools consist in : 1) capacity building tools, such as an internet website that explains how water and pollutants are transferred in agricultural catchments, the role of the landscape structures that may act as a buffer facing to the water quality issue, pedagogic drawings to visualize them in the office and test them in the field ; 2) a modular framework to assess the active areas, the corresponding pollutant pressures based on expert rules for three types of pollutants, nitrates, phosphorus and herbicides. Territ'eau has the objective to fill the gap between research and development. Scientists are largely involved in this policy at different levels. It was performed in operation associates, in various committees, various partners of the development and potential users. The development this framework and tools devoted to the knowledge transfer in the environmental field, associate farmer organisations and research institutes. The framework is generic but the expert rules are specifically developed for the physical and the agronomic environment of Western France, i.e., for catchment with topographically dependent shallow groundwater, dominant agriculture based on animal breeding, landscape composed of rather small plots.	water;agricultural;france;rural areas
651	TLALOC: a spatio-temporal model of vegetation dynamics related to erosive and sedimentologic dynamics in marly gullies. The marly gullies of the French Southern Alps are frequently subjected to torrential floods. The latter are responsible for erosive hazards leading to damages downstream (increase of flood risk, silting of hydroelectric dams). For erosion control, using bioengineering allows creating stabilization of the gully floors, revegetating them and favouring vegetation dynamics. In this context, we developed a spatio-temporal and stochastic model simulating natural vegetation dynamics on the stabilized soil (installation, growth, competition, mortality) at the plant scale, as well as flood events (depending on frequency, date and intensity) and their impact on vegetation. The final objective of this model is to estimate the successful probability of a bioengineering work in sediment trapping.	floods;model;alps
652	Toxicity of sediments from the Stang Alar watershed (Brest) assessed by a battery of bioassays. The toxicity of sediment samples taken along two streams of the Stang Alar watershed (under miscellaneous contaminations) was evaluated by several acute and chronic bioassays with freshwater and seawater organisms. Freshwater assays concerned the photosynthetic activity of an algal monoculture Selenastrum capricornutum and a natural phytoplankton community of lake Geneva, the survival of the cladoceran Daphnia magna and the embryolarval development of a fish Brachydanio rerio. Seawater assays were the Microtox test with the bacteria Photobacterium phosphoreum and an oyster Crassostrea gigas embryo stage test. The sediments of the main stream showed a high contamination by lead and zinc aswell as a greater toxicity compared to its tributary (under a low non-point source pollution). The toxicity was greater when the organisms were exposed to whole sediments compared to water extracts. The Microtox test lead to the better sensitivity and discriminatory ability among the different bioassays.	sediment;lead;water;lake
653	Local application of a new referential concerning the multi-functionality of agriculture: the case of Charente-Maritime and Vendée. The French Agriculture Act of July 1999 established the land management contract as a new tool of French agricultural policy. It aimed to promote the multi-functional aspect of farming and to give new meaning to public financing. The contract was developed through numerous consultations between administrations, professionals as well as scientific and technical experts, with its implementation leaving many possibilities for proposals and measures to be developed at a local level. As a result, the new referential concerning the multi-functionality of agriculture is undergoing numerous adjustments and adaptations as it is applied within the departments. The aim of this article is to analyse how the referential is evolving under the influence of local and national forces then to show how uncertainties within the contract create distortions. It is these distortions which are disturbing the dynamic of implementation and which reveal the strategies of the various players involved in the process. The analysis is partly based on the various documents drawn up at a national level to plan the CTE (land management contract) decree of implementation. It is also based on the compared results of monitoring carried out in the western departments (Charente-Maritime, Vendée) concerning the phases of pre-figuration, of the first decree's implementation and the phase during which measures are harmonised at a regional level.	agriculture;local application;financing
654	Aerobic biological treatment of pig slurry: performance of phase separation systems and characteristics of co-products. The efficiency of four biological aerobic treatment units was studied as regards nutrient removal performances and repartition of compounds (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, copper and zinc). Several type of separators were evaluated : press-auger separator and decanter centrifuge for the separation of the raw slurry and vacuum sieve-belt separator for the separation of the aerated slurry. Between 60 and 70% of the nitrogen was removed in gaseous form. The separation efficiency for the press-auger was 20-25% for phosphorus and 8-10% for copper and zinc. Efficiency was improved with the use of the decanter centrifuge and could raise 80% for phosphorus and 50-70% for copper and zinc. With the use of press-auger for the separation of the raw slurry and vacuum sieve-belt for the separation of the aerated slurry, 90% of phosphorus and the totality of copper and zinc were concentrated in the solid phases. By-products characteristics were obtained during this study. Copper and zinc concentration up to 96 gCu/ton and 194 gZn/ton for the solid phase from the press-auger separator and 140 gCu/ton and 342 gZn/ton from the vacuum sieve-belt separator were obtained.	efficiency;pig;separation efficiency;zinc;phosphorus
655	Aerobic biological treatment of wine effluent in series basins. The recent evolution in environmental legislation for industrial facilities leads wineries to treat their effluents. A range of methods can acheive effluent treatment and some of them will be assessed as the cascade aerated tanks process. The assessment of the this process was aimed at providing a number of answers on the relevance of this configuration, on the design guidelines (in particular the number of tanks, their treatment and aeration capacity), on the expected efficiency. A monitoring period through different measurements allow to obtain knowledge of the hydraulic and organic loads to be treated. A detailed analysis of the biological system permitted to select the pertinent design parameters. For this kind of configuration, a total organic loading on the whole set of tanks of 0,12 kg BOD5 per kg VSS per day is satisfactory.The « cascade aerated tanks » process is found to be a convenient technique, since it showed appropriate treatment efficiency, it has low constraints upon operating, and produces a small amount of sludge. The obtained data will be of interest for the decision-makers, and will help to select the treatment process, evaluate the financial implications and assess the other features.	wine;efficiency;evolution
656	Sludge drying reed beds: recall of technical key points. Sludge drying reed beds exist in France since the early 1990s. These facilities often consisting of 4 beds each being alternately fed during a week have inadequate performance with a dryness around only 15% against 30 or 35% in Denmark where this technology is widespread. A higher number of beds (6 to 8, or more for stations above 15 000 inhabitants) sized globally for 50 kg of MES.m2.an-1, allowing longer rest periods between each feeding, would be a progress. But the essential point lies in respect of a period of acclimatization-development of reeds at mid-load, up to what the density is at least 250 stems per m2. An acceptable dry-matter content of approximately 25% should be obtained if the loadings of the bed(s) to be withdrawn are stopped 4 months before being emptied in summer (between mid July and the end of August). The beds emptied are fed at half load until the end of October considering that the sludge production of the treatment plant should be distributed on all beds during winter.	sludge;france
657	The management of livestock slurries in France : an overview. Effective livestock manure management is becoming a serious challenge in most areas of intensive animal production in Europe due to stricter environmental regulations. In France and particularly in the Brittany region, nutrient surplus districts have now been identified through the EC nitrate directive application and through a programme to control pollution (PMPOA). This programme is being agreed between different partners including Agricultural and Environmental authorities, and the Water Agency. To solve most of the problems, codes of good agricultural practice have been defined which should be strictly follow by the farmers. The major objectives are, to control manure runoff, control odours, ensure sufficient storage and land available (for timely application of manure), and apply manure at agronomic rates. In some cases however, treatment of manure is the only solution. Apart from well established techniques like aerobic treatment, there has been during the last five years a number of new treatment ideas flying around including simple natural processes (lagooning, soil processes) and a process based on the drying of slurry by means of a mixing and heating sequence and a gas compression (Sirven). Most of the others processes evaluated are biological processes coupled to a separation stage (pretreatment). A brief description of some of the operations units developed and evaluated are described as well as their main performances.	france;agricultural
658	Fast imaging system for fertiliser granule motion: a way for centrifugal spreading management. Mineral fertilization by centrifugal spreading is a high polluting process. Since few years, a lot of research have been realized to reduce impacts on environment. For that, centrifugal spreading, and particularly the initial conditions of flight of the granules, have to be very accurately determined and understood. This paper describes the conception of a fast imaging system for the characterization of the fertilizer centrifugal spreading in laboratory. This multiexposure patented system allows to determine the granule trajectories after their ejection, by using a high resolution low cost digital camera combined to a set of flashes, and also different motion estimation methods. The use of a combination between Markov random fields method and a theoretical modelling of the shape of the throws gives very satisfying results, which can be then used in ballistic flight model to predict fertilizer distribution on the ground. This repartition must be compared to a real repartition obtained during spreading hall tests. Prospective are numerous in term of use of our patented system.

659	Transfer of pesticides and metals in a small vineyard watershed. Preliminary study of the influence of hydrologic conditions on the transport of contaminants. The implementation of the European water framework directive implies the intensification of contaminants monitoring, identification of the causes of degradation and implementation of corrective actions to reach a good chemical and biological status by 2015. The aim of the present study is on the one hand, to evaluate concentrations and fluxes of pesticides and metals in a small stream draining an agricultural watershed located in the Beaujolais area and on the other hand, to define a sampling strategy adapted for an accurate evaluation of exposition to these contaminants. The estimation of pesticide fluxes passing through the river during flood events and during grab sampling showed that a single flood event can transport as much pesticides as those mobilized during one month in baseflow.	pesticides;metals;water
660	Nutrient transfers from soil to water - Influence of agricultural practices - Literature review. Nitrogen and phosphorus are found in the soil in various forms. Nitrogen is usually leached in the form of soluble nitrates. Phosphorus is strongly bound to the soil and is carried by erosion and run-off. Farming practices have an effect on the forms of nutrients and the amounts lost and on the way in which they are carried into water courses. Fertilisation, crop rotation, crop residue management, animal effluent management affect the amounts of nitrogen that may be leached; irrigation and drainage techniques play a role in the time taken for the leaching from soil to water. Field improvements, crop rotation and ploughing techniques can damage the soil surface and increase the run-off of phosphorus; regular over fertilisation, especially in stock-breeding farms, increase the loss of phosphorus in the long term. 	agricultural;water;irrigation;phosphorus;nutrients
661	Typology of the forest extensions in Sologne and Boischaut Nord. A study of the vegetation on abandoned agricultural lands led to interest in their spontaneous colonisation by ligneous vegetation in two ecological regions, Sologne and North Boischaut. The study of 55 sites allowed building a typology of these forest extensions. This work also allowed improving our knowledge of the dynamics of ligneous vegetation and determining the economic value of this reforestation. A key to determining the types is indicated as well as an attempt to work out a predictive tool. Within the framework of a development approach, two demonstrative routes are in the course of development.	typology;agricultural
662	Typology of farms and irrigation water demand. The major purpose of the pre-feasibility studies for the hydraulic equipment design lies on the assesment of water demand. The diversity of the farmers behaviours, inducing a high heterogeneity in farm strategies, is analysed throught the development of a farm typology. Regarding the modelling prospects, the typology elaboration requires an accurate identification of farm resources, constraints and strategies for the imput model features. The main aspects of the typology development are : an exhaustive farm census carried out on the survey area, a description of farming practices assumed to reveal farmers production strategies. The specificity of this analysis is due to the irrigation framework in which the farm typology is performed and to the use of economic models to derive the demand of irrigation water.	water;irrigation water;irrigation;farmers;typology
663	Typology and cartography of the average climate in the northern half of France - Prospects for use in forest-environment relations. In order to establish a relationship between the environment and the yield of forest species, this article studies and maps the variability of the medium climate in the plain areas of the northern half of France. The data used are the monthly means of temperature (64 experiment stations) and precipitation (624 experiment stations) obtained between 1951 and 1980. The sums of the temperature values registered between October and March and between April and September reflect the variability of the monthly temperature. A predictive model of the monthly temperature values is defined in relation with the altitude, the latitude and the longitude. The annual precipitations and the type of pluviometric distribution synthesize well the twelve monthly precipitations. The modelization of the water balance using the Thornthwaite method allows one to build an index : the relative water deficit is mainly related to the height of precipitations for the April - September period. This index should be connected with the yield of forest species.	water;environment;france;temperature;climate

The artificial vision is particularly well-adapted to product quality control in the agro-food industry, since it makes it possible to establish a quick, repeatable, objective, non-destructive measurement without contact with the product. Within this context we have worked on research project to assess aspect and quality of animal food products. This paper presents a project of the evaluation of aspect of turkey carcass sets in slaughter plants. After an analysis of industrial problems, the aims of the vision system were defined, the image acquisition system was devised and treatments were developped to detect and identify aspect defects on turkey carcass. These treatments are based on a segmentation method using multidimensionnal histogram of color images. The treatments and measurements were validated on industrial sets to assess the efficiency of the system in an industrial environment. This example shows the benefit of use of numerical vision in the case of complex objects with very unsaturated color defects and under hard industrial conditions and with high speed of plant.	food;turkey;food products
665	An example of territorial policy evaluation: the evaluation of actions relating to breeding in the Alsace State-Regional Plan (CPER). The review of one aspect of a regional policy (agricultural activities linked to livestock breeding) allowed us to test the implementation of an evaluative method based on a general analytical grid comprised of three phases : the policy analysis, a review and evaluation phase and, finally, the assessment itself. Overall, the objectives that aimed at increasing the productivity of the livestock breeding farms were achieved (construction of buildings, enhanced quality of the products). However, on the whole, the subsidies granted did not contribute to the establishment of a territorial balance.	livestock;agricultural
666	A model of torrent erosion. Modelling erosion and the transport of solids into catchment areas is a major objective of research into the dangers resulting from torrential flooding. The general spatial and event ETC model attempts to represent all hydrological and erosion processes in catchment areas subject to torrential flooding, from rainfall through to liquid and solid outflows. Its design and two applications are described. It is currently being developed to allow it to be distributed to engineers responsible for characterising and issuing flood warnings or to define protective measures.	flooding;erosion;model
667	Quick estimate of flood risk downstream a dyke breaching Methods and first stages of validation. The risk caused by the flooding due to a breach across a dike along a river is established with recent disasters (floods in 2002 and 2003 : Gard, Vidourle, Rhône...). One of the main difficulty to assess this risk stays in defining where the breach will occur. To investigate a lot of locations, a simplified method is developed to represent all the processes : dike breaching and fl ood propagation downstream the dike. In this paper, the corresponding calculation methods are detailed and preliminary validation tests are presented.	flood
668	Project of a Historical Flood Marker on the Saone river at Lyon for the Improvement of Flood Memory. A combination of hydrologist and historian is vital in addressing flooding so that the riparian population retain the memory of the risks involved. On the Saône river at Lyon, the researchers intend to make historical information available in the form of a column showing the present water level and the levels reached by the most extreme floods, together with the main vagaries of the river. This is in line with the forthcoming law on risk, which will make it a duty to mark flood levels on public buildings.	flood;water;population;researchers
669	A simulator of ignition and initial fire propagation at road-vegetation interfaces. Most ignition points that propagate fires to French Mediterranean forests and woodlands are aggregated at the vicinity of roads networks and habitat. However, the flammability, ignitability and initial propagation specific to the road-forest interfaces are poorly known. We present here a cellular automaton which simulates the ignition and the spread of fi res at road-forest interfaces, using data of burning experiments in laboratory. Our results demonstrate the relative impact of vegetation composition, management practices, and spatial patterning of the interface on the probability of fire to ignite and propagate towards the interface. The main perspectives of this study are to grade a wide range of interfaces according to their fire hazard level, and to test the effectiveness of different management options for reducing wildfire risk towards forests.	simulator;fires
670	Agricultural practices and environmental consequences. We are trying to relate agricultural practices and water quality on a watershed. After less than one year of work, some first resultats are presented. Inquiries have permitted a global approach of supplies and gave an idea of the amounts of potentially polluting substances spread on the fields. But the comparison between excess of nutrients between the usual supplies and outputs by crops or animals and the fluxes of nutrients measured at the outlet has shown high differences, suggesting that physical processes such as volatilisation of ammonia, denitrification, storages in the soils, have an important influence. Agricultural practices registration suggests that for most of the farms important differences of practices occur between fields : a global balance at the farm scale won't be precise enough for pollution diagnosis.	agricultural
671	Cost-benefit analysis of flood prevention. Application of the damage avoided approach in the Orb catchment. This article explores the relevance of implementing a Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) of flood prevention policies via the Damage Avoided approach. Based on a case study in the Orb catchment (Hérault), the article reminds the different steps of the approach, in particular the modelization of assets in floodplains and the calculus of mean annual damages. The article proposes different ways to present the results : the net present value, a map of potential damage and a map of expected benefits, and shows how these results can contribute to the definition of flood management strategies, for example by the choice of design-floods. The discussion deals with the transferability of the method, its limits and perspectives for further developments.	flood;flood prevention
672	A localized analysis of economic development: the territorial diagnosis, application to 2 small regions of the Massif Central. Between research and action, the territorial diagnosis allows a local analysis of rural economic development mechanism. Applied on two isolated rural areas of Massif Central, it shows different development ways although those areas specifications are aliked. The impact of demographic flows is studied. The role of players organisations on construction or increase of spécific resources, is demonstrated. Thanks to its operational feature, territorial diagnosis may be important help for public policies in rural development.	rural areas
673	A new scale of intensity for avalanches. After different natural disasters occurred in France these last years, French Ministry of Environment wanted to build new scales about of natural phenomena intensity such as volcanic eruption, flooding, forest's fires, atmospheric phenomena (wind, hail storm, ~) and avalanches. The goal is to better qualify each event after it's coming. The main criteria are: - a few physical parameters on the phenomenon itself, - the effective or possible damages on people, buildings, substructures, natural area, - others criteria. The avalanche scale has got 5 degrees, from 1, very low, to 5, exceptional, with a coordinate description. They are independent from the site vulnerability. Non specialists of the phenomenon can understand or use them very often. For one event, usually all the describe parameters are not on the same line level : the choice can be made with the strongest. The physical parameters are surface area, depth of the starting snow, volume of the snow deposit, impact pressure. Human beings are distinguished between observant and carrying along. The effects on the different building parts (openings, wall, roof) are mentioned. The many possibilities for road (vehicle, damages, burying) and for tree and forest are detailed. This new scale uses also the possible noise or unexpected path, and the effects on engineering works for avalanche protection.	avalanches;natural disasters;natural;environment
674	A new method for identifying high avalanche risk sites. The actual avalanche hazard required to be better assessed by making out the possible most dangerous sites. So, a new, simple but simplistic, classification method was developed in order to select 100 to 200 French sites which necessitate special caution, from a wide sample of more than 3000 avalanche sites. The advantage of this method is that one can make use of it very quickly. The disadvantage is that one cannot take into account every subtle particularities of the sites. Even so, the preliminary tests are very encouraging and show that the method may really help to prevent avalanche accidents.	avalanche
675	A new mechanical method for the control of japanese knotweed successfully proved on the Ain and Isère rivers. The recent development of powerful portable machinery for the consolidation of soil on development sites, provides new opportunities for the mechanical treatment of Japanese Knotweed, by mechanical actions directly made on the rhizomes, the only perennial organ of the plant. Further to the success of the first experiment in 2005/2006 on the river Ain, a new experiment had been tried in 2007/2008 on the Isère river and it was a success too. With extremely drastic precautions to avoid the spreading of the knotweed by the worked machines, this method can be used without a complex setting up. Moreover, a direct immersion test of overrun soils in a pond during winter showed with certainty that the site was contaminated. Today, this solution which is envisaged by different river authorities to manage digged alluvia, shows considerable ecological risks for the ponds, and it requires significant precautions to avoid a bank colonization by the invasive plants.	river;isère river
676	An agri-environmental operation to rescue the landscape of the Adour valley. The Landes department has decided to go through a local agri-environmental operation to try and save the barthes. The barthes are a complex of landscapes made up by men on the banks of the Adour, in its maritime part, i.e. under the influence of the tides. These barthes spread, between hillsides and Adour, on about 10,000 ha, 3,000 of which are meadows, 5,000 are forests and 2,000 are crops, corn essentially. In addition to their hydraulic function of water storage,and of flood reduction and elimination, the barthes are lands of spawning grounds and are a shelter for the migrating avifauna and the endangered wild fauna. They offer high quality and diverse landscape sceneries. Unfortunately, this landscape heritage is threatened by the agricultural downturn; it is slowly decaying since agriculture tends to give up this space and leave it to hillside developments. The agri-environmental operation concerns the 3,000 ha usually managed as meadows and involves 300 farmers. It is of interest to both public and private sites for which it recommends the signature of voluntary management contracts that ensure, given a compensation, the respect of environmental constraints: conservation and upkeep of existing canals and of hedges, no use of weedkillers or fertilizers, retention of flood waters in order to favour bird wintering and maintain as they are meadow lands for well-adapted poneys of the Barthe breed, or for gooses.	agri environmental;agricultural;barthes
677	Use of green waste compost for the rehabilitation of fly ash parks: the example of the former thermal power plant of Pont-sur-Sambre (Nord). With the progressive closing of thermal power stations in France, lot of fly ash dump (coal) should be rehabilitated. The revegetation of these places is necessary to have a good landscape integration and to protect soil against erosion. In this context, EDF (French Electric Company) wanted to install experimental plots on one of its fly ash dump in Pont-sur-Sambre (North of France). The fly ash dump has been described by floristic summaries. The selection of herbaceous species and the choice of a green waste compost have been determined due to the scientific literature and the ecological knowledge of the place. Theses choices have been confirmed by laboratory experimentations. At last, experimental plots have been disposed on the dump area. By this way a fast installation and growth of the vegetation has been observed on the plots. Thus, the use of green waste compost can be a good issue to obtain a good landscape integration and a sufficient protection against erosion (ash losses with the wind or the rain-water).	compost;coal;green
678	"Use of satellite data on a national scale to assess the place of grass in ""cantonal landscapes"" and the resulting environmental issues. The human activities, and particularly agriculture, exert various pressures on the environment, that are difficult to approach on a synthetic view. The present work consists on linking two approaches, which make possible to locate and measure the respective importance of the various vegetation covers, especially grasslands, and to appreciate environmental stakes related to agriculture, on units going from the canton to the whole country. First, the construction of a typology at a cantonal scale, organized around the opposition grassland / crops and based on CORINE Land Cover data, gives a description of different "" cantonal landscapes "" characterized by the dominant categories of land cover. Then, as the environmental stakes related to the given land uses are known, it becomes possible, by crossing the data, to map the stakes and to quantify the surfaces on which they can appear."	agriculture;environment;satellite
679	Use of geosynthetics as a substitute for leachate drainage layers in landfill cells. Given the good performance of geosynthetic material for drainage, it seems interesting to use these products to replace part or all of the drainage layer commonly used in landfill cells (silicate materials). The calculation showed that the replacement of a granular layer of 0.50 m by a drainage geosynthetic product is not always as easy as it seems: the maximum water head legally acceptable decreases with the thickness of the studied equivalent solution, which limits its ability to flow. ARCADIS and SITA DECTRA present here a case study on the Romagne-sous-Montfaucon landfill site for which a hybrid (solid granular + geosynthetic) was called.	water;drainage
680	Use of forest habitat by deer (Cervus elaphus) in the Is-sur-Tille massif (Côte-d'Or). The influence of habitat on a locality's frequentation rate and the consumption of woody plants by red deer (Cervus elaphus) has been studied in the Is-sur-Tille forest (Côte d'Or), using PLS (partial least squares) regression; the independent variables are the abundance of pellets (an index of the rate at which a locality is frequented) and the browsed mass of woody plants (an index of the consumption of woody plant material), and the causal variables are 62 and 36 variables (respectively) describing the habitat. The abundance of pellets and the browsed mass of woody plant material were measured from the 2nd of February to the 25th of March 1993 on 193 circular experimental plots, radius 10 metres, distributed over six types of forest plantations. The results seem to indicate that the deer are sensitive to the overall structure of the countryside and particularly to anthropic factors. They tend to occupy only certain parts of the forest sufficiently remote from villages and roads. Within the space used, the deer are likely to be selective to a certain degree with regard to different components of the environment. Their choice is in part based on food-related criteria: they prefer to occupy areas rich in lower layers (below 1 metre) and tend to avoid areas with many types of forest plantations. We have found a positive link between the abundance of pellets on the experimental plot and the presence of forestry tracks at a distance of 200 to 400 metres around the experimental plot. We assume that this relationship reflects the appeal of the deer for peaks which represent good vantage points. The forestry tracks are often at the bottom of the valley and the distance of 200 to 400 metres often corresponds to the summit of adjacent slopes.	environment;forest habitat;deer
681	Use of geomembranes in high altitude applications: examples of PVC-P geomembranes. The aging of PVC-P geomembranes at high altitude is addressed through literature review and the example of a particular water storage pond used for artificial snow coverage. Test results are presented for 3 geomembrane samples extracted from the pond. Probable causes for the early degradation of the geomembrane and associated physico-chemical phenomena are then proposed. Then, the upmost importance of UV protection of geomembranes is underlined.	water
682	Use of indicators to assess the environmental impact of agriculture - Application to organic agriculture in Aquitaine. Over the last decade, protection of the environment has developed into a major issue in public debate in France. French specifications regarding organic farming are designed to guarantee a production process which respects the environment. Using a method based on indicators and agri-environmental diagnosis, we assessed the potential environmental impact of organic and conventional farming methods on the main farming systems present in the French region of Aquitaine. The study demonstrates that organic farming has a highly positive overall impact on all components of the environment. It also highlights the risk situations associated, principally concerning conventional techniques, but also those inherent in organic farming.	agriculture;environment;organic agriculture;france;organic farming
683	Valorization of historical information for the predetermination of flood risk: application to the Guiers watershed.  Collaboration between historians, archivists and hydrologists can provide a significant improvement in the field of flood hazard studies, by using historical information about floods. This Historisk methodology was first applied in 1996 on river Guiers, which has a good historical information during the 18th and 19th centuries. This river was the old borderline between France and Savoy, and so many reports are available and concern the boundaries of the two areas. The analysis of more than two hundred archives allows the qualitative collection of the most important floods since the second part of the 18th century, and the establishment of a guide, which presents the different archive sources about floods. An example of the Historisk methodology is carried out by estimating the discharge of the 1875 flood on river Guiers at Pont-de-Beauvoisin.	flood
684	Reuse of treated sludge from reed beds, first experience feedbacks of emptying and land spreading for some French wastewater treatment plants. The sludge extracted from reed beds have mechanical qualities which exceed those of sludge of comparable dry matter content, making its spreading easier and homogeneous by manure spreaders equipped with vertical well sharpened cutters and turning at high speed. For DM content of 20 to 25%, these sludge could easily claim the status of solid and stabilized sludge according to the French regulation (for land spreading of sludge from wastewater treatment plants) that would allow temporary storage on plots. The dissociation emptying-spreading would respect the ideal time to empty the bed(s) to schedule between July 15th and late August to benefit both the evapotranspiration and not to undermine the regrowth of reeds in the beds before winter without having to wait the end of the harvest on spreading plots.	sludge;treated sludge
685	"Enhancing the value of local fruits: the example of the ""Pomme des Alpes"". Using the example of the apples grown in the southern French Alps, this paper describes the measures taken by agricultural entreprises within a particular area to promote fruit. An investigation amongst apple growers and their customers produced a positive image of the ""Pomme des Alpes"" within the industry and identified ways in which this produce could be improved to meet market requirements. The investigation showed that the measures taken to promote this produce came up against technical, commercial, organisational and psychological obstacles. The authors show that it is not enough for the produce to originate from an area that is well-known the agricultural enterprises should form an organisation to draw up a specification and must be able to guarantee the origin and quality of their produce."	agricultural;apple;fruits
686	Variability of aquatic macrophyte populations in large watercourses: first results on the Adour-Garonne hydrosystem. Macrophytes are an important functional group of rivers. They are primary producers such as habitats for many organisms. They are also used to assess running water quality through the Macrophyte Biological Index for Rivers (I.B.M.R.). In rivers downstream areas, macrophytes distribution seem to be more likely determined by physical factors (out-flows, substrates, depth, turbidity~). Natural discontinuities (confluence) but especially artificial ones (such as dams) can greatly influence these physical parameters and then the aquatic vegetation. As part of the ECOBAG program, started in 2000 in the Cemagref, eight study sites, located upstream and downstream to discontinuities, were chosen in two rivers of South West of France (Dordogne and Garonne). Macrophytes are regularly sampled on these sites during summer. First results illustrate interrelations between macrophytes development and physical parameters and allow us to present some ecological trends.	water;populations
687	Towards a tool for dimensioning grass-covered buffer zone to limit the flow of phytosanitary products transferred by runoff. Scenario tests. Vegetated strips can be useful in order to limit pesticides fluxes transfered from agricultural fields towards surface waters. However, these structures must be judiciously positioned and well proportioned to be really efficient. In this article, we assess the efficiency of vegetative strips to limit surface runoff in contrasted situations, representative of different parts of France. The modelling tool is HYDRUS 2D, which represents variably saturated flow in soil. Three agro-pedo-climatic situations were investigated: 1 - La Morcille, in a vineyard area near Lyon, with very permeable soils and intensive runoff events, 2 Le Pays de Caux, where soils are very sensible to hortonian surface runoff, and 3 La Jaillière, near Brittany, where soils are often hydromorphic. Results show different trends for each ensemble of scenario, representative of a given agricultural area. They also get prominence to the fact that it remains necessary to design each vegetative strip individually, taking into account the very local context. The more influent variable were identified ; this allows to give an order of magnitude of the efficiency of a vegetative strip to limit surface runoff, without a complete simulation, given its own characteristics and those of incoming runoff.	agricultural;vegetative;pesticides;runoff;grass;efficiency
688	Towards intelligent automatic tractor control. The number of electronic devices is increasing in tractor cab, and that could generate a stress on the driver. In some case, he doesn't inform himself of his running work characteristics. The supervisor, an onboard computer, will substitute these electronic boxes, by collecting the different data from the sensors of the tractor. Its goals are to filter these informations, and then to display the most appropriate of them. It provides advices for better adjustments of the tractor-implement system. According to its level of evolution, the supervisor will manage itself automatisms and collect data for a better economical management of the work in plots. The paper presents the concept of the supervisor for an agricultural tractor and its different levels of evolution.	evolution;tractor;agricultural tractor
689	Towards an assessment of the total economic value of Alsace's groundwater table. The objective of this article was to raise the basis of the total value estimation for the Alsatian aquifer. This work is constructed around three principal points: (i) the use and non use values identification; (ii) an exhaustive quantifying of all the effective charges through a data base building; (iii) a parallel of the use and non use benefits with the monetary valuation methods. An exhaustive account of all the effective charges in the aquifer has established a charged volume between 624 et 717 millions of m3 per year. The second result is based on the industrial activity weight in the total charged volume of the aquifer (more than 70%). These results represent only the first step of a more ambitious work: the total value estimation for the aquifer, knowing that the choice of all the relevant monetary indicators have to discussed before.	economic
690	Towards an assessment of the vulnerability of agricultural activities to flooding. The former evolution of flood risk policies put the stress on the original concept of vulnerability. Even though agriculture manages the largest part of territory, this concept hasn't been yet applied to this field. Our research aims to (1) identify vulnerability criteria of agriculture activities (2) clarify their functions and relative importance. The methodology combines case studies and different systems analysis tools. 47 criteria have been identified, analysed and their functions ranked. Some of the results have to be confirmed by further analysis. Nevertheless, they already offer perspectives to enhance public policies on flood risk management.	agricultural;flooding;flood risk;evolution;research
691	Towards a joint management of areas and landscapes in the middle-range mountains: the contribution of research work which is under way. The territory-planning notion in France dates back to the '60s, but concerns relating to land-expanse and landscape management are far more recent. In spite of the statutory progress, it remains the creation of the conditions for the implementation of an efficient landscape policy in answering the questions which call out land-expanse managers and landscape acting people, for the mid and long run. This document expounds in three stages, the work under way conducted by the multidisciplinary teams of the various partners of the Clermont-Ferrand hub: natural conservation scientists, foresters, agronomists, animal-husbandry specialists, pastoralists, landscape gardeners, sociologists, economists and computer scientists. The first stage consists in describing, on the one hand, landscapes and their components (relief, vegetation, human structures) in their ecological dimension, and on the other hand, the organisation and management methods of these areas in their human dimension (social, cultural, economic), and to understand their operation and their dynamics. The second stage consists in planning and simulating the possible or probable future developments, at the scale of a plot, then at the scale of acting people and territories. The third stage leads to the identification of new actions by proposing management techniques suited to possible uses of these areas, without forgetting the assessment of actions and public policies and the various ways to call upon the acting people.	france;research
692	Towards an operational forecast of nitrogen flows resulting from manure spreading: parameterization of a dynamic model for the simulation of manure nitrogen transformations (STAL). The European Directive on Nitrates and the publication of the Code of Good Agricultural Practices nowadays encourage the better use of effluents from livestock rearing, since their careless use, which is often seen, leads to water and air pollution. This being so, it seems important to improve the prediction of the nitrogen fertilisation value of livestock effluents, as compared with existing operational models, and to make available tools capable of evaluating the environmental impact of agricultural practices. To respond to this need, a dynamic simulation model of transformations of nitrogen from slurries, called STAL, was developed and parameterised; the novelty of the procedure rests in the modelling coupled with volatilisation and biotransformations (i.e. nitrification, immobilisation and mineralisation), which takes into account competition between processes. STAL brings together effects of weather, slurry composition and application methods on the fertilising value of the effluent and contributes to the environmental evaluation by calculating ammonia volatilisation and nitrification dynamics. The accent has been put on the creation of an operational model, calibrated from readily acquired data, and evolving so as to easily incorporate new functions and processes.	nitrogen;nitrates;manure nitrogen
693	Machine vision at a plant scale: methodologies and applications. Machine vision at a plant scale, which involves an on-field image sensor, allows specific applications, such as plant counting, automatic weeding, or vegetation detailed characterisation. Plant characterisation first addresses agronomical researchers, e.g. for growth modelling or seed selection. But overall, complete technical solutions should then allow the agricultural producers to optimise their cultural operations in terms of product quality, chemical inputs and environmental impact, by taking into account in-field measurements. However, the kind of machine vision approach brings out various difficulties, from outdoors lighting control to leaf overlapping problems. We present here the main techniques that can be used to overcome these difficulties - some of them still being at a research stage - as well as various application examples.	researchers;machine vision;agricultural
694	Lysimeter study of the effect of a vegetative strip compared with maize, and bare soil on the leaching of atrazine and DEA. The efficiency of a vegetative buffer strip to reduce pesticide leaching is poorly understood. Using lysimeters (2m*2m*1m) filled with a silty soil, we compared the effects of rye-grass, maize and bare soil. Leaching was monitored for an application of 250 g/ha of atrazine, which is more than would arrive in run-off. The treatments were compared under irrigations, with equal drainage, equivalent to 350 mm in 5 months, allowing the overall effects of differences in dissipation and preferential transfers on leaching to be estimated. Aerial rye-grass and maize residues were exported, to investigate the effect of root system principally. The results show that under the conditions of this experiment the rye-grass root system enhances the purifying power of the soil and suppressed the leaching of atrazine and partly that of DEA. For the DEA, less adsorbed, a risk of leaching may occur when the pesticide is highly available on the soil surface under the conditions of rapid transfers. The maize had no better purifying effect than bare soil. The effectiveness of rye-grass is attributed to dissipation, due to the large root biomass in the 0-30 cm layer. The value of a grassed strip is greater for weakly adsorbed molecules.	pesticide;atrazine
695	Renovating urban drinking water systems - An economic optimisation approach. Many approaches have been developed for analysing the deterioration of water distribution systems: these can be classified as reactive approaches and predictive approaches. The approaches have been modelled using descriptive statistical models or predictive probabilistic models. The Proportional Hazard Model, proposed by Cox in 1972, is a probabilistic predictive model which gives an accurate description of how water systems fail independently of the stresses to which the pipes are submitted. Economic studies have been carried out to fill out the model. The problem consists in determining the optimum time for replacement. This paper puts forward a new ageing model. A detailed study of the various costs was carried out and some of the costs were analysed. A feasibility study of this model on the basis of nine streets in the Urban Community of Strasbourg was made using technical data provided by the Paris Suburban Water Company.	water
