0	An innovative approach to modelling forest fire risk based on the mapping of wildlife-urban interfaces, a new key to understanding the territory.. A method to characterize and to map wildland-urban interfaces (WUI) is developed in the context of wildfire risk. The WUI mapping on the territory allows a new compartimentalisation of the territory: inside WUI and outside WUI. By establishing relationships between WUI distribution and forest fire history (departure of fires and burned areas), certain types of territory appear with high levels of risk: high fire ignition density values, high wildfire density and high-burned area ratio. A model of a total fire risk index has also been developed.	fires;wildfire;urban interfaces
1	"Implementation of two result-based agrienvironmental measures: the ""flowering meadows"" and the «pasture management"" measures. In order to meet society's demands for a more environmentally friendly agriculture, a system of agri-environmental measures has been put in place by the European Union. Two agri-environmental measures allow the commitment to be tested on results: the ""flowering meadows"" and the "" pasture management"" measures. The obligation to achieve results makes it easier for farmers to adhere to these measures, as they retain freedom of practice and see it as a social recognition. However, the commitment to results has also limits when agricultural and environmental objectives are incompatible or when the result is hard to control by agricultural practices alone. Sharing a diagnosis and understanding objectives and constraints of the different stakeholders are then key-factors."	agriculture
2	"The issue of ecological equivalence in designing and sizing appropriate offsets for impacts on biodiversity and natural habitats. Changes in the regulatory context have reinforced the obligation to compensate ""in kind"" for impacts on biodiversity that could not be avoided or reduced. In this context, assessing the equivalence between the losses caused by these impacts and the biodiversity gains expected from compensation actions raises scientific and technical questions about the concepts and knowledge to be mobilised and the assessment methods to be developed and implemented. In particular, it involves identifying the biodiversity elements to be considered, developing appropriate indicators to compare losses and gains, selecting a reference state for calculating losses and gains and taking into account ecological dynamics and uncertainties in assessing the fate of offset sites. Through these issues, ecological equivalence provides an explicit reasoning framework for the design and dimensioning of compensation that can be appropriated by each of the stakeholders concerned."	biodiversity;ecological
3	Interpretation of monitoring data on pesticide contamination of surface water by a hydro-ecoregion approach. The study of the state of surface water contamination by pesticides at a monitoring station is necessary to meet the requirements of the European Water Framework Directive. Faced with the results of millions of point analyses of the presence of pesticides in surface waters, we have developed an interpretation method based on the grouping of data by a hydro-ecoregion approach. This method was developed based on herbicides because data and measurements on these substances are more readily available than on fungicides or insecticides. We first present the available data and their limitations in terms of analysis and interpretation; we describe the method developed, the results it provides and then conclude with a critical analysis of the method and possible perspectives. The method for assessing the state of contamination could be used to study the links between pressure and contamination and between contamination and impact on aquatic organisms.	pesticide;water
4	Compensatory measures for environmental damage in infrastructure projects: new legal requirements for improved practices?. The compensation for the residual impacts of planning on natural environments stipulated by law since 1976 is not always well applied. Regulationshave been reinforced and with them come new technical requirements that complicate matters and increase the land pressure. However, important gaps remain to be filled in order to improve the consideration of biodiversity and ecosystem services.	
5	Environmental impact of shredded tyres as embankment fill material. The first studies on the environmental impact of used tyres when used in civil engineering date back to the end of the 1970s. Since then, detection methods and the sensitivity thresholds of measuring systems have evolved considerably, as has knowledge of the consequences of the various compounds. The study presented here completes and updates these data, on a very wide range of potentially releasable compounds, with more efficient measuring means. Tests of percolation, leaching and in a lysimeter were performed on the raw material as well as on the residue resulting from fire. The liquids were subject of physico-chemical analyses, considering 200 compounds, and ecotoxicological analyses on a shellfish and a bacterium. Measurements reveal a very limited consequence on the environment, except in the case of fire, where residues must be considered as hazardous wastes. 	environment
6	Plant diversity as a component of the ecological performance of motorway planning: case study of Mont-aux-Liens (A19).. Regulations and societal expectations are now encouraging land developers to assess the environmental impacts of their construction projects, but also to plan measures and actions to create or restore the biodiversity of modified areas. However, ex-post assessment of restoration or creation projects requires appropriate methods and materials. The “Mont-aux-Liens” case study, a landscaping development adjacent to the A19 motorway, showed that plant species diversity was a good indicator of ecological performance of such a development. Quantitative assessment (specific richness) shows better results than those expected initially but qualitative assessment reveals that few sown species have settled and that the site is highly colonized by exogenous species. Ecological characteristics and adaptative strategies of the flora explain these results. They provide useful information for redefining objectives adapted to improving the ecological performance of the planning, from the point of view of plant biodiversity.	biodiversity;ecological
7	Biodiversity offsets: how to improve environmental records and governance?. Biodiversity offsets require ecological equivalence between losses due to project impacts and gains expected from offsets. In this article, we provide an overview of recent practices in the design of ecological compensation based on the analysis of eighty-five derogation requests from the ban on the destruction of protected species submitted in 2009 and 2010 to the French National Council for the Protection of Nature (Conseil national de protection de la nature,CNPN). To do this, we drew up an analysis grid to compare all the files. This grid does not require expert knowledge and can be used for any type of environmental study, applicable to various biodiversity components.  This analysis highlights several weaknesses in the design of offsets for impacts on protected species of fauna and flora. Building on our observations, we suggest ways for improving offset design and discuss governance mechanisms for implementing them in the compliance process. 	biodiversity
8	The dynamic mapping of wildland-urban interfaces: a territorial analysis tool for wildfire risk prevention. Wildland-urban interfaces – corresponding to areas where urban areas meet and interact with rural lands – are increasing and a matter of concern for the management of the risk of wildfires. The study of the wildland-urban interface dynamic allows quantifying them in order to have a better control in the future. The aim of this analysis was to identify territories where prevention actions and targeted communication – to reduce wildfire spread by reducing biomass and [reduce] wildfire ignition through more cautious behaviour –have to be made a priority. In our study, the evolution of wildland-urban interfaces focuses on the French Bouches-du-Rhône department over a ten years period (from 1999 to 2009). At the department level, the analysis showed an increase of 10 % of wildland-urban interfaces in ten years. At the forest massif scale, the analysis highlighted forest massifs for which isolated and scattered wildland-urban interfaces increased. These wildland-urban interface types cause serious problems:  it’s difficult to manage them because of their dispersion on the territory; in terms of control, they are difficult to access. It is thus important for these wildland-urban interfaces to promote every prevention actions that will reduce the ignition of a house in case of a wildfire.	wildfires;urban areas;urban;urban interfaces
9	Achieving the good status objective for groundwater bodies affected by diffuse agricultural pollution: where and how to act to be cost-effective?. In France, more than 40% of groundwater bodies are affected by diffuse agricultural pollution. The Water Framework Directive requires to implement cost-effective action programs in order to achieve the good status objective by 2027 at the latest. However, the selection and design of cost-effective action programs raises several methodological issues. This paper proposes a new framework to implement a cost-effectiveness analysis that links results from participative methods and modelling by integrating economic, agronomic and hydrogeological approaches. The approach is applied here to a groundwater body located in the Ain alluvial plain in France. We show that implementing longer crop rotations on the South-East part of the groundwater body would be sufficient to reach good status. The results also highlight the uncertainties related to the evolution of groundwater quality, show that current agri-environment schemes are insufficiently attractive, and may be inappropriate to achieve good status of the water body by 2027.	water;france;agricultural
10	"River Flood variability and agricultural options in the Inner Niger Delta:  cultivation of rice or bourgou?. The Republic of Guinea is planning to build the Fomi dam in the Niger basin. It will be a dam with an embankment of 42 m high, for a reservoir over 507 km² and a volume of about 6.2 billion m3. This study focuses on the ability of irrigation to offset losses undergone by breeders and fishermen in the delta, due to the impoundment of the Fomi dam. Data from 70 small village irrigation schemes located in the Mopti region were used to compare the average income of a hectare of irrigated rice to that of a bourgou field, a grassy vegetation formation dominated by Echinochloa stagnina, known locally as ""bourgou"". The results show that irrigated rice cultivation and exploitation of natural bourgou fields are both profitable. Currently in the delta, the average annual income is 440 109 FCFA/ha. The annual income of a natural bourgou field is estimated at 341 320 FCFA/ha. However, in addition to the economic benefits of bourgou, bourgou fields favour the devlopment of aquatic  fauna. However, irrigated rice is slightly more profitable than growing bourgou. Similarly, the sale of dry matter of a regenerated bourgou field proved less profitable than the sale of paddy rice."	niger;irrigation;agricultural;rice;rice cultivation;guinea;flood
11	Spatial comparison analysis of farm patterns and water catchment areas. The protection of drinking water catchment areas (CA) is a major sanitary and ecological issue for local authorities and other stakeholders in water management involved and impacted by the implementation of action programmes in their territories. Many regulatory procedures concerning water quality preservation begin with the definition of territorial boundries by means of hydrology. However, these boundaries intersect with those of agricultural plots. Understanding how these two overlap is of interest for water agencies and water distributors looking for solutions that take into account both, water quality and farmers’ working constraints. The combined use of GIS layers for delimiting areas and agricultural national databases, such as the graphical parcel register (registre parcellaire graphiqe, RPG), makes it possible to incorporate these issues by analysing indicators such as the share of farmland of the catchment area cultivated by each farm (weight), or the share for each farm of its farmland included in the water catchment area (importance/concern).	water;agricultural
12	The “Concert'Eau” approach: an example of participatory management of agricultural practices and water quality. How to achieve changes in agricultural practices to improve water quality in the catchment area of Gers, France? To answer this question, the project Concert'Eau was organized around two main ideas. First, instead of proposing modifications of agricultural practices to the stakeholders and asking them to choose among them, we asked to these stakeholders to propose themselves the practices. Secondly, we propose a scientific evaluation of these proposed practices. The evaluation was based on indicators chosen by the stakeholders to assess the consequences of these practices, for a shared diagnosis, for a less confrontational debate and the possibility of the emergence of policies for improvement. During the implementation of the project, it was possible to think about the nature of the participatory process of the construction of public policy and about its effectiveness. It appeared, despite the difficulties of their implementation, that these collaborative methods brought added value to these constructions. The project also showed that decision makers, including those of the public sector, were helpless in the face of the procedures that break with their traditional culture of the proposal of action and the policy decision. This article describes the development of this project.	agricultural;water
13	What techniques can be used to revegetate riverbank riprap?. Riprap application on riverbanks is a biological interruption within the shoreline environment and the use of vegetation (plant-based engineering techniques) is preferable to it. Additionally, when the use of riprap is required, it is best to revegetate for landscape, ecological and occasionally mechanical reasons. Also for existing riprap, if it is not possible to remove or replace it with vegetative techniques, it is better to incorporate vegetation within the existing riprap. This article briefly reviews the various existing revegetation techniques and then presents the results of experiments to revegetate riprap conducted on the banks of the Arve River. Five techniques and their costs were compared. Among these techniques the simple covering of soil over rocks associated with seeding and live cuttings is the cheapest. The beneficial effect of the geotextile is not clear from this experiment, although it is known to improve the environmental conditions and hold the soil in early years, before being replaced by roots. The drilling technique to insert cuttings is very expensive, but allows for very high survival rates. Three unusual riprap revegetation techniques involved in the river Columbia in Canada are also presented.	
14	Drought governance: the case of the Lower Vilaine River Basin (Brittany, France). The impact of climate change on the water cycle requires an anticipation of the variability of the water resource.  Although the problems caused by drought in Northwest Europe are currently not highly visible, early actions should be taken to reduce costs and prevent damage.  In this context, the European project INTERREG IVB DROP proposes to explore drought governance in 6 case studies located in North Western European Region. The notion of governance refers here to the context in which the projects to combat drought and water scarcity are implemented. The results presented here are those from the analysis of interviews conducted in 2013 and 2014 with stakeholders of the Vilaine catchment and more specifically of the downstream-Vilaine concerned with the management of the Arzal dam. It emerges that, despite a highly developed and effective governance of drinking water management - in which the Vilaine Planning Institute (IAV, Institut d’Aménagement de la Vilaine) plays a pivotal role as coordinator of the river basin management authority (the SAGE Vilaine) as well as being the manager of the Arzal dam - local drought governance in relation to climate change still appears to be rather weak.	drought;water;climate change;river
15	Sustainable revegetation of iron mine tailings of North-Eastern Québec and Labrador: selection of plant species, creation of a living soil and root microbial symbioses. The revegetation of iron mine tailings of northeastern Québec and Labrador faces several technical challenges, due to the poor fertility of the soil, the importance of wind erosion and the northern climate. The company Irrigation NORCO Inc. has been efficiently addressing these challenges for more than 18 years on several tailings sites. The technology used is based on the primary use of hay mulch to control wind erosion, an in-depth knowledge of the local flora adapted to the region, and the use of biological fertilizers which permit, in addition to providing organic amendments, to restore the soil microbial life. Soil analyses realized over the years testify to the creation of a fertile soil. Root mycorrhizal analyses demonstrate that symbiotic hyphal networks re-establish themselves very rapidly on vegetated sites, with nevertheless a great variability among plant species. It is to be hoped that the effectiveness of Irrigation NORCO technology will be allowed in the years to come to continue the revegetation of the hundreds of ha of virgin tailings remaining which are destined to remain artificial deserts without human intervention.	iron mine;wind erosion;irrigation
16	Better planning with ecosystem services?. The contribution of ecosystems to human well-being is central to any sustainable development and landscape management policy, which should include economic, social and ecological components. Sectorial regulations (concerning e.g. forestry, farming, water, urban development, biodiversity, etc.) often drive land use decisions, but they offer limited scope for developing integrated land use plans and policies. Instead, the disperse decisions across a broad range of stakeholders which often find it difficult to develop coordinated approaches, let-alone integrate the necessary ecological processes and functions than support land use options. The ecosystem services concept offers one avenue for integrating various sectorial concerns into a common framework, but hasn’t been widely applied yet in France. In this paper, we explore how ecosystem services were used to update the protected area policy of a local government in France, and their potential in urban planning and environmental impact assessments in the same area. Our analysis shows that ecosystem services do offer a way to renew the way environmental concerns can be framed into concrete land use decisions if they are consistent with the legal background of decision-making procedures, and transformed into operational solutions for use by decision-makers. Although scientific and technical developments remain essential, this also requires innovation at the science-policy interface.	
17	Focus on the capacity matrix, a tool for assessing and consulting on ecosystem services. In order to provide help for decision-making in a context of revision of the Water Development and Management Plan (SAGE) and define measures adapted to different natural habitats and activities, a method for assessing ecosystem services of wetlands was applied on the territory of Scarpe-Escaut Regional Nature Park.  The concept of ecosystem service was initiated to support conservation efforts by demonstrating the role played by ecosystems for human well-being. It has been rapidly expanded and is now omnipresent in the design of policies to preserve biodiversity and ecological functions. Combining mapping of wetlands with the creation of a tool through local consultation, this method provides a new reading layer for the territory, which complement the existing data. In this paper we present the approach and methodology used as well as main results developed.	wetlands
18	Is cattle manure a high-potential resource for biogas conversion in France?. Agricultural biogas is a growing sector that will make use of as yet unused resources. Cattle manure is a potential resource for this sector. In this study, an inventory of French cattle manure production was undertaken by combining different databases from Agricultural Statistics (2010 French Agricultural Census, 2010 Cattle National Database Inventory) and livestock practices found on the French territory. The main results of this study show that total cattle excrement production amounts to 87 million tons per year and that farmyard manure is the main effluent with 69 million tons produced each year. Compact and very compact manure with total solids content higher than 18 %, represent a large part of the total cattle manure production (70%). Based on their physico-chemical composition, valorisation of these manures in biogas plants by solid state anaerobic digestion may be considered. However, the cattle manure resource is highly fragmented in the national territory and on the basis of current technical and economic criteria, only some farms could integrate the agricultural biogas sector. In order to better mobilize this resource it will be necessary to either pool the manure produced by several farms or to add co-substrates with higher methanogenic potential or to switch to another biogas valorisation mode.	cattle;france;agricultural;livestock
19	Create new ecosystems through nature-based methods: the case of Mediterranean green roofs. The creation of new ecosystems is a complement to conservation and restoration to fight against biodiversity erosion. In urban areas, roofs are an opportunity to test it. Nevertheless, techniques must be guided by ecologically related natural habitats. Botanical surveys were conducted in southeastern France which allowed us to identify hundreds of plant species that can be used on roofs in a Mediterranean climate. Of these, 80% are still not commercially used, especially the annual species. A screening process was then developed based on the use of functional traits accessible in databases. Thirty-four species have obtained the best scores possible. Eighteen were tested as their seeds were easily available. End of 2012, experimental green roofs were built in Avignon and Heverlee (Belgium) which vary in the depth of the substrate and exposure. After a two-year survey, the situations with the thickest substrate and shading position showed the most important plant cover and species-richness. However, in all cases a persistence of the newly created plant communities was measured after the summer and winter periods, thanks to the regenerative abilities of annual plants, which allows to predict their sustainability on the long term.	
20	How to design ecological connectivity in urban areas?. Natural areas contribute to improve the quality of life in urban areas. In 2014, the city of Strasbourg (North Eastern, France) initiated a project to characterize connectivity between all the remaining natural areas. Graph networks have been used to design a framework to be applied by landuse planners. The connectivity of the landscape was determined on the basis of the definition of the optimal habitat of the Red Squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris), its travel preferences and its mobility in the city. The objective of this article is to present our original approach to identify the most favourable links, to evaluate the importance of certain habitat patches and to describe a potential connectivity at the scale of the city of Strasbourg. We demonstrated that this ecological framework can be an effective diagnostic tool to understand the issues of connectivity and a foresight tool to guide long-term planning policies.	areas;urban areas;natural areas
21	Improvement of the sizing methods of riverbank bioengineering following an empirical approach. The choice of plant based engineering techniques used to protect the riverbanks generally depends on expert knowledge based on an empirical approach. In fact knowledge on dimensioning elements, especially concerning hydraulic stress, is still very fragmentary and the main obstacle to the development of plant-based engineering techniques used on riverbanks. To improve the methods an observation-based approach can be taken by gathering shear stress values which structures have withstood in the past. In this article we first gather values from the literature and then present new values based on hydraulic quantities characteristic of the morphodynamics of the minor river bed (considered at the river section level). The new values show new possibilities for some techniques which were underestimated until now. They also give more details about the evolution of the resistance of the vegetation [engeineering] structures over time. The limits of the approach and the indicative nature of the values obtained are then examined.	riverbanks
22	The odyssey of environmental future studies for the Mediterranean. Future studies were designed to critically address trends, or “business as usual” analyses, to question and make visible boundary making processes that separate endogenous and exogenous variables, determinisms and random events, and upon which public policies are based. How can future studies contribute to shed light on the political choices that underlie environmental policies? To address this issue, this article is based on the study of the Blue Plan, an ambitious international foresight programme designed to feed international and regional debates on cooperation on environmental matters of concern. Analyzing the foresight studies carried out by the Blue Plan on water issues allows us discussing their impact on environmental public policies in the Mediterranean countries, as well as the nature of the Blue Plan and its strategic action.	
23	Adapting management practices to the different soils in Europe: a tool for farmers and advisors. Farming practices that reduce the amount of carbon in the soil can disrupt soil microbial activity, soil structure and water and nutrient supply to crops. They can also make soil less capable of regulating greenhouse gas emissions. The EU-funded CATCH-C (Compatibility of agricultural management practices and types of farming in the EU to enhance climate change mitigation and soil health) initiative focused on best management practices to reduce and prevent these problems. The effects of soil management options were identified from a meta- analysis of 300 long-term experiments in Europe and presented, along with contrasts and synergies, in a web-based decision tool that summarises the costs and benefits of sustainable practices for farmers, the public and the environment. The tool is available in seven languages and provides scientifically validated guidelines for better soil management, around which EU soil policies can be shaped.	environment;agricultural;farmers;greenhouse gas emissions;europe;farming;climate change
24	Nutting conceptual models: a toolbox to estimate Nitrogen and Phosphorus loads and retentions of water bodies . Assessment of pressure and impact of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) on continental water bodies is a major environmental issue in the context of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) to achieve “good ecological status”. This paper presents a toolbox called Nutting, whose aim is to estimate nitrates and total phosphorus loads and retentions in all French WFD subdivided watersheds. This toolbox is a set of conceptual models, statistically calibrated on national or regional environmental datasets. These models, fitted at different scales (from 2000 km² to the whole of France), provide flux and retention results when in-situ measurements are not available.	water
25	"French regional green and blue infrastructures: how do they take into account the national ecological connectivities?. The “trame verte et bleue” (green and blue network) is a public policy that the Ministry of the environment started in 2007 to protect and restore ecological networks at the national, regional and local scales in France. At the national scale, a policy framework includes the ecological connectivities of ""national importance"" named CEIN. The French regions had to take them into account within their regional schemes, named SRCE. Now that SRCE are adopted, it is time to have an overview of this new and original system and to evaluate its effectiveness and efficiency. The methods used by the regions to take into account the CEIN have been identified. The results show that the majority of the regions have demonstrated, after having identified their network, that they take the CEINs into account. Yet, an independent assessment is needed to verify that these national stakes were sufficiently taken into account. This study also shows that CEIN helped the regions to create interregional and transboundary corridors. Thus, this first analysis validates such a framework in its current form and conception. In the future it could be extended, for example to nocturnal ecological connectivities to preserve the environment against light pollution."	france;ecological;environment
26	From climate change to changes in agriculture at the village level:  a foresight approach in India. Agriculture in India is highly concerned by adaptation issues as climate change is projected to have significant impacts on cultural conditions and in consequence on food security. There is a call for local measures to adapt to climate change and participation of local actors. In this context, we used a foresight study framework to discuss with farmers about changes in agriculture, land and water in Sorapet (South India). This article presents: the method implemented; the changes in this village within the past 10 years; the 3 contradictive scenarios for 2040 discussed with stakeholders. The foresight exercise produced an interesting setting for the dialogue between farmers and researchers resulting in focusing on issues such as attachment to agriculture. A participative foresight with local stakeholders as in this study is novel in India. This experience confirms the interest of the foresight approach in promoting alternatives. Yet it has to be developed while questioning further its distance to local practices.	india;agriculture;farmers;climate change;food;south india
27	Biodiversity and economic development: what are the territorial impacts of ecological compensation?. Biodiversity conservation policies have a potentially significant socio-economic impact, and not only because they impose restrictions on economic activities. The purpose of this article is to examine, through the emblematic case of ecological compensation, how biodiversity conservation can translate into new economic activity, not only through the redistribution of resources over a territory, but also by reinforcing existing activities for which there is potential demand. Through case studies carried out in Isère, it shows that the implementation of compensation can have significant positive impacts, provided that the coordination of the various local policies is sufficiently effective and that a real dialogue exists between the different categories of impacted actors.	biodiversity;ecological
28	Evaluation of the success of the Romanche riverbank protection structure at the Livet dam, carried out using plant-based engineering techniques. At the interface between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, riverbank plant engineering is inspired by and uses the natural capacities of plants as basic material for bank reconstruction. This alternative to civil engineering gives ecosystems a better capacity to return to more natural and above all more diversified systems. However, ecological restoration and particularly plant engineering techniques suffer from a general lack of evaluation of success and feedback on the development of species and the performance of different techniques. This article presents the approach adopted as well as the main results of monitoring the redevelopment of the banks of the Romanche River at the Livet dam (38), carried out using mixed techniques combining riprap and different plant engineering techniques. In particular, the authors have demonstrated the interest of using local species in plant-based engineering. Similar monitoring can be envisaged for other structures, by adapting the monitoring protocol to the types of vegetation and environment studied.	environment
29	An operational monitoring and alert system for cyanobacterial blooms: application to water bodies in the Landes. The large lakes of the Landes have bathing areas regularly monitored for public health by the environmental services of the Community of Municipalities of the Great Lakes (in French CCGL) and the community of municipalities of Mimizan. Regulations impose biological monitoring, especially for cyanobacteria, as they are potentially toxic to humans (due to cyanotoxins production). However, analyses are carried out in the laboratory and have a response time of at least 36 hours, which is damaging to sanitary safety and leading to important financial costs. The work carried out jointly by Irstea and the CCGL makes it possible to propose the reduction in response time and to limit the costs by modifying the monitoring and alert decision tree with the use of a fluorimetric field probe. The adapted decision tree is based on thresholds of cyanobacteria quantities expressed in chlorophyll-a equivalent, instead of the number of counted cells usually practiced. It provides at least the same safety level and is, sometimes, more protective than the regulatory protocol. This work enables the CCGL to implement a monitoring and alert protocol for cyanobacteria based on the use of the fluorimetric probe during the summer seasons.	water;great lakes
30	Economic implications of groundwater protection choices for drinking water supply. Water managers may face different alternatives of water protection to ensure drinking water supply to the population. This article highlights the economic implications of groundwater protection alternatives through the analysis of three contrasted evolution pathways of drinking water catchments. Economic evaluation approaches are applied to two original case studies to show the costs and environmental co-benefits of groundwater protection. This article points out that it is necessary to go beyond the simple comparison of preventive and curative actions, by considering also into the analysis the costs of restoring groundwater quality and the environmental co-benefits of groundwater protection over the long term.	water
31	Taking biodiversity into account in impact studies: promising but incomplete developments. It is now recognized that anthropogenic activities are a determining cause of biodiversity erosion. In this context, man attempts to combine environmental and political interests through laws that regulate development and through instruments such as impact studies. The aim of our study is to measure the inclusion of biodiversity through impact studies and to see how it evolves in the face of changes in public policy. The systematic analysis of 42 impact studies shows an improvement in the inclusion of biodiversity in impact studies over time with, among other things, a clear effect on new regulations. However, this improvement remains to be qualified at different levels: e.g. analysis of alternative solutions, cumulative impacts, ordinary species, ecological functionalities, monitoring-evaluation We then put our results into perspective with the contributions of the law of August 2016. Finally, we conclude on the need for a change of scale, towards a proactive and anticipatory approach to the impacts of land use planning well upstream of the project scale, right from the planning stage, in order to move closer to No Net Loss.	biodiversity
32	Riparian wetlands, sinks or sources of phosphorus in agricultural landscapes?. The grass-covered buffer zones placed in riparian wetlands are used for interception and retention of agricultural pollutants, such as phosphorus transferred by erosion from upland fields. The aim of this study is to assess the risk of remobilisation of phosphorus (P) accumulated in the wetlands of a catchment area in Brittany. It consisted in monitoring the concentrations of dissolved P and particulate P in the river and in the wetland soil water. The role of riparian wetlands was then placed in the context of the continuum of P transfer along a catchment (area), taking into account P arrivals from upland plots (by erosion) and the risk of transfer to the river (by solubilisation). As shown by the results of this study, wetlands behave like bioreactors that can convert particulate phosphorus accumulated in grass-covered buffer zones to dissolved phosphorus. Over time, riparian wetlands can evolve from sinks of particulate phosphorus to sources of dissolved phosphorus that is more mobile and more bioavailable.	wetlands;grass;erosion;phosphorus;agricultural
33	Monitoring by satellite imagery of the dynamics of the banks of the Logone, between the Maga reservoir and Lake Tchad. Endorheic watercourse which contributes more than 90% to water supplies of Lake Chad and natural border between Cameroon and Chad, the Logone-Chari system has often been studied in terms of variability of the hydrological regime and of the risks associated with floods in the neighboring plain. The evolution of the riverbanks, which involves important socio-economic and strategic stakes, has until now been little documented. The objective of this study is to contribute to the assessment and characterization of the dynamics of the eastern banks, part of the Cameroonian territory. The methodology combines discretization of the active band on multi-chronic Landsat images, field observations and surveys and analysis of data in a GIS.  The results indicate that advances and setbacks follow one another over time, due to variations in hydrological parameters and the diversity of the alluvial material. In 30 years, variations range between -200 (decline of the banks) and 171 meters (fattening of the banks) in the section of the Chari in the north of Kousseri, against -121 and 125 meters in the section of Logone in the South. For the same period, there is a territorial gain of almost 853.32 ha, representing the differential between fattening (1,397.1 ha) and decline (543.78 ha). However, this evolution is not linear. It is done in jerks, during the seasonal cycles, following processes interrupted by negative feedbacks. The sinuous or braided areas are the most exposed. Although shoreline erosion is essential to dissipate the energy of water, protective measures should be considered where the safety of property and persons is threatened. The integrated management of the Logone plain should take into account the necessity to preserve a minimal space of freedom around the banks, in order to allow the water to retain its potential for lateral and longitudinal adjustment.	water;cameroon;evolution;floods;lake chad;chad;satellite
34	Landfill siting studies: determinant of exclusion and selection criteria in view of regulation and stakeholders strategies. The choice of a location for new sanitary landfills is defined through siting studies involving multi-criteria analysis and the use of a geographic information system. This article analyzes the exclusion criteria used by project holders while assessing the degree of constraint induced by environmental regulations and how it influences the criteria selection process. Then the selection criteria mobilized by the various project holders are compared in order to obtain a comprehensive view of the issues addressed. The analysis shows that the logic of the stakeholders is rarely correlated with the consideration of local characteristics but is influenced by the scale of the territories concerned by the projects and by their temporality. These results support the idea that decision-making is closely linked to the roles, functions and strategies of the actors involved in the decision-making arenas.	landfills
35	Constructive collaboration between naturalist associations and research: an example on amphibian distribution modeling at departmental scale. In this article we present the result of a collaboration between academic and naturalists networks. The valuation of a significant database of amphibian presence via modeling their ecological niche was used to map the potentially favorable habitats of four protected species in France: the natterjack toad, the great crested newt, the European tree frog and the Mediterranean tree frog in six French administrative departments (Indre-et-Loire, Indre, Creuse, Haute-Vienne, Corrèze, Ariege). We used two methods of modeling, ENFA and MAXENT and we determined the most effective method with the available data. This work has helped improve knowledge of the studied species and to provide potential distribution maps of species that can be used as reflection tool for setting up conservation actions in these territories.	research;amphibian
36	Dwarf bulrush (Typha minima Hoppe) populations in the Isere River: monitoring and restoration perspectives. Over the last three centuries, river management has considerably transformed and artificialised the watercourses of the alpine piedmont rivers. Among the species present in these impacted environments is the dwarf bulrush (Typha minima Hoppe). Its most important populations are located in the French Alps rivers such as the Arve, Isère or Durance, where it is protected at the national level. As such, after avoidance and reduction, the residual impacts on its populations must be compensated. The restoration of populations of T. minima poses questions to which this article aims at providing some answers. The study of the ecological niche of T. minima at the Isère shows that it is not possible to predict the presence of favorable habitats from Isère hydrogeomorphological characteristics. However, our results show that in order to optimize their survival, population transplantations will have to be carried out on banks with gentle slopes at elevations slightly above the average water level. Concerning the transplantation methods study, early trends suggest that the three types of transplants tested, namely containers, buckets and bare roots, can lead to the establishment of viable populations, even if containers and buckets give better results the first year.	populations;alpine;water
37	A methodological framework for assessing the equivalence between biodiversity losses and gains induced by development projects and their offsets. In France, the mitigation hierarchy aims to achieve the “no net loss” (NNL) of biodiversity at the development projects scale. One of the key issues to achieve this goal is to demonstrate the ecological equivalence between the gains associated with offsets due to compensatory measures (CM) and the losses caused by the impacts. Despite regulatory improvements, the French law does not include a method to follow for determining equivalence, and none is unanimously recognized. This leads to heterogeneous practices and difficulty in reaching the NNL. In this context, we have developed a methodological framework for assessing equivalence adapted to the French regulatory and ecological context and combining three challenges: operationality, scientific basis and comprehensiveness. This methodological framework makes it possible 1 / to evaluate the biodiversity found on impacted and compensating sites by taking into account ordinary biodiversity ordinary and high-stake biodiversity with a focus on functionalities; 2 / to estimate the value of the indicators after impact and MC in the short and long term, taking into account associated uncertainties; and 3 / calculating losses and gains leading to a quantitative and transparent equivalence assessment. The use of the methodological framework favors dialogue between actors and also allows monitoring of offsets over time.	biodiversity;france
38	Changes in carbon stocks along management trajectories in wetlands. Ecosystem services (ES) should now be taken into account in management schemes and impact studies. In face of climate change, global climate regulation by ecosystem carbon storage is key ES . This is especially the case for wetland protection and restoration, which as fragile ecosystems are already managed for conservation. We used a state-and-transition model for 24 wetland plots to determine whether such management actions can change their carbon stock. Aboveground biomass of forested wetlands stored twice as much carbon as herbaceous undrained wetlands. Soil organic carbon stock was unchanged across the three studied main states, and was thus independent of their vegetation. This study highlights the importance of the wetland soil carbon pool for global climate regulation, as it represented > 50 % of the total carbon stock for the three studied states, but also the difficulties to manage this complex pool. Also, it points out the advantage of state-and-transition models to follow and/or project management effects on ES. This approach could be used in the context of the mitigation hierarchy for No Net Loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services	wetlands;climate;climate change;carbon;ecosystem carbon storage;global climate;carbon pool
39	Two-faced urban wetlands in Dakar: Opportunity or threat?. In Dakar, wetlands are natural spaces containing an essential part of urban biodiversity. They are a natural heritage to preserve (Lézy-Bruno, 2010). Although their usefulness is recognized by all, their maintenance clashes with the desire to occupy more space (Aschan-Leygonie, Bonnaud and Girault, 2015, Beaumais et al., 2008). The conservation of wetlands in the heart of the city poses more and more problems, inherent to urban dynamics. Currently, wetlands appear as a constraint to urbanization in some districts of Dakar. They disappear in favor of housing and public infrastructure. Paradoxically, wetlands polarize various socio-economic activities (agriculture, fishing, livestock farming, etc.) in the city. As a result, they are subject to conflict between several actors (state authorities, populations, environmental protection organizations). However, beyond the conflicts, it is a question of an opposition between two apprehensions of the use of urban natural landscapes. While the need to enhance these natural spaces is evident to some stakeholders, others believe that they need to be re-qualified or re-assigned to residential uses and related activities.	wetlands;heritage;urban wetlands
40	Improving the integration of ecological functionalities in the mitigation hierarchy. The mitigation hierarchy does not give enough importance to the impacts of development projects on habitat connectivity. However, environmental policies and the objective of no net loss of biodiversity underline the importance of preserving ecological networks to limit the habitat fragmentation. The failure to fully understand spatial dynamics and understanding of ecological functionalities cause these shortcomings at all stages of project design. We propose here a methodological framework encompassing all these steps: from the assessment of conservation issues, by quantifying the overall impact of a development project on the habitat connectivity, to the dimensioning of ecological measures, by defining their optimal location to maximize their gains. To this end we combine a species distribution model with a landscape functional connectivity model. The case study of the new football stadium in the metropolis of Lyon has highlighted the importance of this integrated approach to decision-making processes in land use planning. This method is a valuable contribution to support both policy makers and project developers applying the mitigation hierarchy to protect biodiversity, as well as for environmental authorities.	protect biodiversity
41	How lessons learned from preliminary field observations of pioneer spontaneous vegetation can inform civil engineering projects: what are the revegetation and stabilization potentials of the Sélune Riverbanks prior to dam removal?. The restoration of ecological connectivity along the Sélune River (Normandy, France) involves the removal of two tall hydroelectric dams (36 m and 16 m high), a project without precedent in Europe. In the pre-removal phase, the reservoir’s slow draining (2014–2018) allowed to conduct a showcase engineering project focused on sediment management in order to avoide excessive delivery to the river’s downstream sections. Progressive spontaneous revegetation of the Sélune Riverbanks, as sediments were exposed, has been surveyed since 2015 in accordance with the modalities for conducting civil engineering works aiming to stabilize sediments. The lessons learnt can inform the ecological restoration approaches to be implemented. A great diversity and a habitat mosaic characterize the spontaneous vegetation colonizing an old reservoir (90 years old). Ecological functions provided by this vegetation highlight an opportunity to consider the options of a full and fast revegetation and a sediment stabilization over several dozen hectares. However, the season when the water level decreases affects patterns of this initial development. Moreover, riverbank profiling works that were executed very belatedly negatively affect the plant community's trajectory. The relevance of considering preliminary field observations along reservoirs can help limit profiling works, which goes against the advantages obtained after 2,5 years of passive ecological restoration. 	civil engineering;pioneer;ecological
42	Ecograzing as a management tool for artificial dykes: the example of the Donzère-Mondragon hunting and wildlife reserve (Vaucluse-Drôme, France). The beneficial roles of extensive grazing practices on vegetation diversity and species-richness are well established. Domestic herbivores have been widely used as management tools in many semi-natural ecosystems. On the other hand, the modification of environments by human activities and their strong artificialisation have led to the creation of new ecosystems presenting new combinations of species and functions. Their conservative management must then be rethought. Will the eco-grazing management practices traditionally applied in natural areas have impacts similar to those observed during the conservation of historic ecosystems? This is the question we tried to answer in our study on the artificial dikes of the Rhone in the hunting and wildlife reserve of Donzère-Mondragon. We have shown that the grazing systems used to maintain the openness of habitats increase the species richness, diversity and heterogeneity of vegetation in the short term compared to the absence of management or mechanical interventions. These different results correspond to those already obtained in semi-natural environments but experiments should also be conducted in the future using mixed grazing systems to increase the effect of restoration at the expense of competitive shrub colonization.	eco grazing management;natural areas
43	How can we map land use to model ecological networks? General methodology and case study in the Île-de-France. This paper aims to propose a methodological framework for land cover mapping, particularly for its use in modelling ecological networks. The quality of the modelling results is highly dependent on this step carried out upstream, which is however rarely detailed in the bibliography. We therefore propose to explain the approach and the different steps that lead to the realization of a precise mapping of the land use of a territory using the different GIS databases already available. We then we present a case study for the Île-de-France region. The objective of this article is to provide a basic, operational and essential decision-making tool for space managers or researchers for a better understanding of the territory and the issues related to ecological networks in France.	ecological
44	Use of RFID technology to evaluate fish passage through a 104-meter long culvert along the Durolle River. In 2016, a hundred meters long culvert was fitted with a unique hydraulic device consisting of a rugged sole and pre-casted decelerators in order to restore the free movement of fish. This device was developed using hydraulic simulations to ensure favourable conditions of crossing for trout during flows between QMNA5 (value of the monthly low water flow reached by a river in a given year calculated for 5 years) and 2.5 times the module. The module corresponds to the inter-annual average hydrological flow over a reference period (at least 30 years of consecutive measurements). The actual functionality of this device was evaluated between 2017 and 2019 using RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) technology and following the movements of tagged trout using PIT-Tags (electronic devices that emit response when they receive an interrogation by radio). A total of 815 trout were tagged on a 1680-meter stretch downstream of the culvert. Ninety-nine (99) individuals were captured upstream and released downstream just below the culvert after tagging, in order to force an upstream migration behaviour. A fixed double RFID antenna structure set up immediately upstream of the culvert enabled us to detect fish that crossed the culvert throughout our study. In addition, seven mobile tracking campaigns took place to characterize the movement of the tagged trout along 2 km downstream of the culvert. The data from the antennae were analysed in relation to the individuals' characteristics and two environmental factors, namely hydrology and water temperature.	water;trout;fish
45	Risks governance related to biological invasions: the example of Benin. The spread of invasive introduced species increases because of the accelerating rate of globalisation. These biological invasions can have numerous negative consequences on biodiversity, economy, agriculture and health. In the case of the Republic of Benin, an African developing country, biological invasions are unacknowledged and public authorities do not seem to act based on the gravity of the situation. In this article we will examine the difficulties encountered for a country like Benin in managing the risks linked to IAS, but also the different possibilities, opportunities and initiatives already underway. 	
46	Taking better account of biodiversity issues and ecological connectivity in territories thanks to prospective scenarios. Ecological conservation is fundamental for maintaining biodiversity and the ecosystem services it provides. However, few territorial assessments take into account recent and future natural and anthropogenic dynamics, particularly changes in land use and land cover, to identify habitat networks that are robust over time. Prospective approaches, already used in various fields including land use planning, can make it possible to take these spatio-temporal dynamics into account. We show here the limits of two main types of existing land use and land-cover change scenarios and how they can be combined to assess changes on a regional scale with very fine spatial and thematic resolution. Such scenarios and the assessment of their consequences on biodiversity and habitat networks, or more generally on different environmental indicators, are particularly useful as a decision-making aid or to get different categories of stakeholders to think together about a desirable future for the territory. 	biodiversity;dynamics;ecological
47	Bioavailability of dissolved contaminants in the aquatic environment. The bioavailability of a chemical denotes its ability to interact with living organisms in the environment. The main environmental factors that alter and control the bioavailability of some chemicals (metals, hydrophobic organic contaminants, pesticides) in the aquatic environment are presented. Three integrative sampling tools that improve the characterization of chemical exposure, approaching the assessment of bioavailable concentrations, are also presented. Finally the consideration of the bioavailability of substances in environmental chemical risk assessment is discussed.	environment;chemicals;aquatic environment;pesticides

Benthic macro-invertebrates are one of the most widely used organism groups in river biomonitoring surveys.

Constant deterioration of the aquatic ecosystems has intensified the need for relevant assessment methods of environmental quality, based on species biology and ecology. Also known as ""life history traits"", biological and ecological traits bring together all the qualitative and quantitative information associated with the biology of organisms and their relationships with the environment.  In this context the use of biological and ecological traits provides new perspectives for biological assessment methods. We propose, through the example of both diatoms and macroinvertebrates, to see how these bioecological traits are used in term of toxic bioindication."	environment;ecological
50	Bio-indication and fish assemblage in watercourses: a functional and predictive approach. Recently, new methods for the assessment of rivers based on the response of fish assemblage to human alterations have been developed at the national and European scales. The original approach developed in the US (Index of Biotic Integrity) has been improved in order to consider the natural environmental variability and to quantify the biological response as a deviation from an explicit reference condition. The aim of this article is to briefly present the principles of the method used in France in the development of bio-indication tools based on fish assemblage in watercourses, to summarise the different conceptions underlying the definition of reference conditions and finally to discuss the points that are still being developed.	fish;france;rivers
51	The French Localization Map of Avalanche Phenomena (CLPA): stakes and prospects. The French Localization Map of Avalanche Phenomena (CLPA) was created in 1971 as a response to the deadly avalanche occurred in Val d’Isère (February 1970, 39 persons killed). The aim is to inventory and to memorize areas where avalanches occurred in the past in order to keep in memory precisely greatest limits of those avalanches. The CLPA was rapidly considered as an essential element for developing plan in mountain areas. After the other catastrophic avalanche, which occurred in the Montroc Village (Chamonix) in February 1999, it was recommended “the mutual valuation of the EPA and the CLPA integrated into an information system containing the information on avalanches and the information on the other natural risks in mountain”. The ministry in charge of environment decided therefore to continue and to modernize the CLPA, mission that was assigned to the Cemagref with the ONF collaboration. This modernization was based on the end of maps and testimonies records digitizing, on the compilation of summary notes concerning main avalanches information in reference to a mountain massif, on the institution of a durable updating of the map and on the possibility of having all information on line on the website www.avalanches.fr. Information recorded in the data-base is really important for research. Now the Cemagref want to capitalize on it with numerical models and calibrated tools. Specific parameters could be used in order to develop statistical laws which could be used for not well-known sites so.	avalanche
52	Analysis of the spatio-temporal fluctuations of avalanche numbers in the Northern Alps using the French Permanent Avalanche Survey (EPA) database. Avalanche activity is surveyed in France by the National Forest Office and the Cemagref. The characteristics of all events occurring on certain sites are registered. The usual valorisation of this data is local predetermination. The database has also some interest from the phenomenological point of view thanks to its standardised protocol and to the length of the data series. As an illustration, this article analyses the fluctuations of avalanche numbers in the northern Alps over the last 60 winters. The spatio temporal structure that is highlighted can be linked to the geophysical characteristics of the different mountain massifs and to the large scale climatic variations. On the other hand, the obtained avalanche frequencies can be used in an operational context for evaluating return periods.	france;alps;avalanche
53	Avalanche hazard and risk evaluation: advantages and limits of standard engineering methods and prospects for the future. For natural hazard management in mountainous regions, design values and return periods are often used in a questionable manner. This article aims at reviewing the existing methods for predetermination and risk computations in the case of snow avalanches. After a reminder of the classical engineering methods, the recently developed statistical-dynamical approaches are introduced. They allow rigorously defining the return period as a one-to-one mapping of the runout distance and evaluating all reference scenarios corresponding to the chosen return periods. Finally, as soon as hazard consequences are quantified as a function of their magnitude, a decisional approach can be used for hazard zoning and the design of defence structures. The proposed framework is illustrated with a case study from the French avalanche database.	zoning;avalanche;natural hazard
54	Modeling for the design of protection structures: study of the Taconnaz avalanche site. This article aims at showing how recent knowledge developed in the field of avalanche research can be used for a real case study, the Taconnaz avalanche path in which passive structures already exist but has to be improved. First, a morphological analysis of the site is carried out and historical data are analyzed. Second, each recorded event is back-calculated thanks to a numerical model of dense flowing avalanches and, for each surveyed avalanche, parameters at the entry of the run-out zone upstream of the defense structures are defined. Third, a statistical analysis of these parameters allows characterizing the hundred year return period events. Fourth, physical and numerical models of the dense avalanche interacting with defense structures are combined in order to design the most effective passive structure able to contain the reference avalanche. Finally, physical and numerical modelling of the interaction between the powder avalanche and the designed defense structure are performed to show that the proposed improvements do not increase the residual risk due to the powder part in areas downstream of the defense structures.	taconnaz avalanche;design
55	Behaviour and design of civil engineering structures exposed to dynamic loads: the case of snow avalanches defence works. This article proposes an easy accessible synthesis of main principles related to the physical behaviour of civil engineering structures impacted by snow avalanches. Improving knowledge of pressure due to an avalanche on a civil structure is an essential step to design resistant protective structures. In situ experimental devices using structures as macro-sensors is an original and innovative way that complements the existing research approaches mainly based on hydrodynamics and fluid mechanics principles. General principles for design and building for rigid civil engineering works are presented.  Finally, operational recommendations are proposed to improve the dynamic loads and therefore global risk assessments.	civil engineering;research
56	How to manage the risk of avalanches on mountain resort roads: an analytical attempt. The risk management of avalanches on access roads to winter sports resorts constitutes a collective problem, which calls upon particular procedures, is based on specific instruments, implies various liability regimes and mobilizes a variety of interventions. This article proposes an analysis of the discrepancies observed between the theory of management and the actual reality of its implementation in local tourism contexts. The vulnerability considered here is not limited only to passive elements, such as roads. The endogenous dimension of the risk is considered through active factors of vulnerability arising from the organisational complexity and the concrete difficulties of management methods.	avalanches
57	Comparaison between different types of snow drift sensors. Wind-transported snow is a common phenomenon in cold windy areas such as mountainous and polar regions. The resulting snowdrifts often cause problems for infrastructure and road maintenance and contribute significantly to the loading of the avalanche release area. It also reduces visibility. It is very important to better determine drift snow fluxes in the framework of forecast or mitigation. This article reviews the different technologies available such as mechanical traps, acoustic or optical sensors. It bases its conclusion on essays carried out in wind tunnels and in situ at the Col du Lac Blanc experimental site, which is dedicated to the study of drift snow. If acoustic sensors are not as promising as expected, optical sensors give accurate results. However, in this case the measurement area is small. The coupling with a theoretical approach is therefore still indispensable.	wind
58	Hedges and afforestration to prevent damage from snow drift: from theory to practice. Blowing and drifting snow can generate snowdrifts on roads and railways. This is an important issue for instance in the Massif Central (France) where even limited snowfall on vast areas can locally lead to huge snow accumulations. This problem is not new and prevention measures were designed and tested as early as the end of the 19th century. However, the development of efficient snow clearing vehicles in the second half of the 20th century led to some decrease of research efforts (mostly a trial and error approach) on traditional prevention measures such as afforestration and hedges. Nevertheless, the renewed interest in ecological engineering, dating from the early 90s, has yielded new research efforts on this topic, even though such measures are not effective in the short term. Currently, bioengineering techniques meet the requirements of sustainable development and therefore of long-term management. In this context, this paper aims at taking stock of hedges and afforestration, taken as protection measures against snowdrift, through the eyes of a fluid mechanics researcher, a forester and a manager. The principles of action, setting and species choice are presented through case studies with emphasis on difficulties related to land property as well as long and short-term maintenance.	hedges;research

60	Waves in mountain reservoirs: analysis and methods for prevention. The load of the wind and the impact of rapid gravitational movements in a reservoir generate waves whose nature and properties depend on the magnitude of the load and the water depth in the reservoir. In this paper we summarize the main existing scaling laws allowing assessing the resulting hydrodynamic effects, focusing not only on the amplitude of the waves, but also on their nature. Wind and slow gravitational movements produce sinusoidal waves while rapid gravitational movements produce steeper waves such as tsunamis. Given the limited extension of the mountain lakes, the produced waves rapidly meet the shores or the dam on which they generate a run-up whose amplitude depends on the characteristics of the incident wave and the slope of the shore. We have undertaken a theoretical analysis and collected several experimental data in order to show the similarities and the differences between the sinusoidal waves and the solitary waves in terms of run-up. We finally choose simple formulas and produce a chart enabling any engineer to make a first diagnosis.	water
61	Flood flow prediction in torrential watersheds of the French Pyrénées range: the ANETO approach. Flood flow estimations in torrential watersheds suffer from numerous uncertainties. In order to guide practitioners to predict realistic orders of magnitude of these flows, a method based on statistical regression and geographic analysis (ANETO, acronym for Approche naturaliste et statistique pour l'estimation des débits de crue des bassins versants torrentiels pyrénéens) was designed by the Restoration of Mountainous Territories (RTM) department of the National Forest Office (ONF). ANETO is part of a process of updating and regionalisation of methods based on multiple regression analysis published by the Technical Centre for Rural Engineering and Forestry (abbreviated CTGREF in French) in the early 1980s. In addition to these initial objectives, a significant improvement in the performance of these approaches has been made possible by introducing into the analysis process the consideration of factors related to the climatological environment and the geomorphology of catchment areas. The field for application of the method corresponds to watersheds of the French Pyrenees, ranging from 4 to 500 km² in area. It takes into account classical hydrological parameters, and integrates climatic and geomorphologic characteristics, which significantly increase the performance of the model.	flood
62	Geomorphological approaches for the characterization of torrent sediment yield. The sedimentary yield of torrents, defined here as the sediment transport that can reach the apex of the alluvial fan, is the resultant of a complex system that integrates the geomorphic dynamics of hillslopes, the coupling between hillslope and stream bed, and the sediment routing in the stream beds. Its characterization implies integrating the multiplicity of processes involved in the internal sedimentary transfers of torrent systems. The geomorphology proposes an indirect way to deal with this issue, by assessing fluxes from forms. The objective of this paper is to present the state of the art of geomorphological approaches and to present some case studies in the French Alps.	sediment
63	Functional analysis and hazard assessment in a debris-flow-prone torrential watershed: the case of the Réal torrent (Alpes-Maritimes, France). This paper presents a detailed functional analysis of the Réal torrent (Péone township, Alpes-Martitimes). Despite a relatively small watershed, this torrent is a large producer of debris flows. Its bed is characterized by a marked aggradation phenomenon. The performed analysis treats all aspects of the torrential processes: hydrology, identification of sedimentary sources, rheological and hydraulic characterization of debris flows, bed evolution since 1950, role of existing torrent control structures, and qualification of hazards. A scenario for future evolution of the torrential activity is proposed, and the main axes of a possible control and protection program are defined.	france;evolution
64	Analysis of the debris-flow hazard on the Rioulong torrent (Hautes-Pyrénées, France) alluvial fan using a scenario-based approach. A method of debris-flow hazard analysis, based on the use of the Cemagref LAVE2D model, within the framework of a scenario-based approach, is applied to the Rioulong torrent. A preliminary analysis of the watershed leads to conclude that some risk of debris-flow occurrence is present and to specify scenarios accordingly. Numerical simulations are carried out based on these scenarios. They make it possible to specify the maximum extension of debris-flows for different probabilities of occurence characterised qualitatively. These simulations also provide some useful information for the design of a protection dam. Finally, they allow an analysis of the maximum extension of debris-flows resulting from the installation of this dam 	france
65	From design to safety and reliability assessment of torrent control dams. To reduce risk levels in areas prone to mountain stream floods, structural defence works remain indispensable. The global efficiency of those protection strategies depends on both functional and structural approaches. This article first presents the main types and functions of torrent control dams. It then describes the design and building requirements with references to the main failure situations that could be encountered. This technical background is identified as a basis for danger and risk analysis that is going to become mandatory for some categories of torrent control dams.	floods;global efficiency;design
66	Design tool for rockfall net barriers with ECRANS software. Rock instabilities are among the hazards frequently encountered in mountain areas. In order to reduce the associated risk, the so-called passive strategy aims at implementing protection techniques that allow to control the trajectory of moving boulders. Among these protection techniques, the use of rockfall net barriers is a particularly effective solution. This paper will present a numerical tool for sizing rockfall net barriers in an illustrative way. The proposed simulation examples demonstrate the fundamental role that numerical simulation can play in the analysis of the interaction between a hazard and a structure. The calculation code that has been developed constitutes a tool to guide the manager in the choice and definition of a successful strategy. In particular, it is possible to explore the residual performance of a structure after impacts, as well as the effect of the failure of an organ (anchor, post, ring...) on the overall behavior of the structure.	
67	Rockfor.NET : the first tool for a rapid assessment of the rockfall hazard downstream of a protection forest. There are presently no clear and precise rules for determining the protective function of forests against rockfall, taking into account dendrometric parameters, topographical characteristics of the site, as well as the size and maximum energy of rock projectiles. In order to provide a tool that meets theses requirements and that quantifies the protective capacity of a forest at the scale of a slope, we have developed Rockfor.NET (freely available at www.rockfor.net). This paper explains the underlying principles of this utility, as well as the calculation methods used. Furthermore it presents the case studies that served for its validation.	rock
68	Rockfall protection embankments: from experiments to numerical modelling. Rockfall protection embankments are soil levees aiming at intercepting falling boulders at the toe foot of slopes. Based on the need for optimisation of these structures, a new type of embankment is proposed. It consists in using geocells to build a modular structure. To develop this technology, an intensive study was initiated, combining an experimental approach with numerical modelling based on a multi-scale approach. This paper describes the approach, presenting the experimental and numerical methods implemented. Beyond its technical scope, it illustrates how research approaches can improve the comprehension of structures under severe loadings and leading ultimately to optimized design tools adapted to the needs of engineering.	research
69	Characterizing the practices of a cropping system with respect to sustainability. In order to analyse the performances of four crops systems, a procedure combining environmental, technical and economical criteria was set up. The analysed crops systems relate to four actual farms in the Midi-Pyrenees area. Their production targets are very different and linked to specific assets and restraints, which have been identified. After detailing the cropping practices implemeted, the indicators chosen to evaluate theses practices and the results obtained are described and discussed. This analysis shows that no crops system is in every respect superior to the others, but that it is possible to characterize the performance of each in its own context. Firstly this analysis enables farmers to situate themselves in relation to the sustainability of their farm, secondly to imagine ways to improve their practices, and thirdly to put forward their practices with regard to regulations or possible certifications.	
70	"Towards a sustainable viticulture: how to assess the environmental dimension of its management?. The increasing power of the concept of sustainable development has resulted first and foremost in an increasing demand in terms of respect for environment. Viticulture is an agricultural production particularly concerned because of the quantity of pesticides used (20% for 3.7% of cultivated areas - France, 2005). The existing ""environmentally friendly"" techniques to produce grapes are not unanimously recognized, and their consequences on the economic viability of farms are little or not assessed. In order to clarify the concept of environmental practices, work on the environmental characteristics of viticultural managements was undertaken. This notion was combined with an economic valuation based on costs and the method then tested at the end of 2007 on approximately twelve wine farms in the Gironde. Few farms feature an environmental practice of grape growing, and no systematic link between environmental practice and costs has been identified for the moment."	economic;viticulture;france
71	"Environmental management of pig farms: a proposal for field indicators. Pig production being faced with environmental issues, it is suggested to internalize its enviornmental management in the pig farms by providing them with specific tools. Nine initial indicators are proposed for swine farms that would allow individualised management at the farm level and open to the possibility of pooling within a network (establishment of ""references""). They quantify consumption (water, energy) and direct emissions (NH3, GES and odours), mineral outputs (N, P205, Cu and Zn) and waste, expressed per kilo of pork produced. The indicators are based on data available on the farm, or else assessed through existing techno-economic analysis methods. A field test carried out in seven pig farms shows their sensitivity within and between farms. A gain is thus obtained compared to the use of average standards. In some cases, however better monitoring methods are required for a reliable assessment."	pork;pig
72	Environmental assessment of dairy production systems: comparison of conventional and organic systems with the EDEN tool. The EDEN tool assesses the sustainability of dairy farms. EDEN is based on the conceptual framework of life cycle assessment for the environmental component, complemented by economic and social performance indicators. This article presents and applies EDEN-E, the environmental component of the tool, for the environmental assessment of a group of forty-seven dairy farms, including forty-one conventional (CONV) and six organic (BIO) farms. For the impacts studied, this study largely confirms previous results concerning the effect of production method on impacts. The organic farms in the sample had fewer impacts than the CONV farms per hectare of land occupied, but between organic and CONV there were few significant differences per 1,000 kg of milk (only the agricultural area used). Moreover, the study strikingly reveals that for the sample of farms examined, the contribution of production mode to overall inter-farm variability is modest.	agricultural;milk;production
73	"The environmental challenge of the mechanical performance of spreaders. New European standards were defined in the year 2003, regarding the spreading distribution for solid and liquid manure spreaders. The requirement levels of these standards were set up by considering the actual performance of this equipment. On the hand, no agronomic was carried out for these requirements and it is currently impossible to state whether they are insufficient or excessive from an environmental point of view. By using fertilization software programs we could establish the fertilization balance of a field for an application by three different spreaders qualified as ""bad"", ""medium"" and ""good"". These simulations show that the spreading heterogeneity does not influence automatically the nitrate lixiviation. Finally, the present requirements of the European standards can be stated as ""reasonable"" but are insufficient when using highly concentrated manures like some composts or broiler manures."

Environmental performances of spreaders are currently evaluated by transversal and longitudinal distribution indicators obtained according to the standards NF EN 13080 for manure spreaders and NF EN 13406 for slurry tankers. As part of the National Research Agency project Ecodefi, new indicators were created to allow environmental performance evaluation of spreaders according to technical parameters beyond those required by the standards. These new indicators allow a more precise evaluation of spreader characteristics such as the fertiliser distribution on the field, the dose, the fractionation, the ejection, the compaction and the rutting, the power and efficiency of the spreaders, the resource consumption and the cleanliness of the spreading work in the field. Only the indicators of distribution, dose and fractionation were tested and validated with experimental data from trials on manure and slurry spreaders conducted at Cemagref Montoldre and at the Cormier research station (Brittany regional chamber of agriculture), respectively.	environment
75	Potential for biogas production from crop residues or dedicated crops in France. Biogas production potential relies on two main aspects: organic resources suitable for anaerobic digestion and performance of the production pathway from an energy and environmental point of view. The paper presents a first evaluation of potential biogas production in France from agricultural land, involving crop residues (wheat, maize, rapeseed, sunflower) and crops devoted to biomass production (alfalfa, silage and maize). The evaluation at the national level and at the level of each of the 95 French departements shows a potential production of about 10.6 Mtoe/yr, 5.15 Mtoe /yr from crop residues and 5.5 Mtoe /yr from biogas crops. An environmental analysis was conducted on the territory of the GRCETA.SFA, concerning 143 farms in Aquitaine, Southwest of France. Energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were estimated in different systems corresponding to the conditions in the case study area. Fodder Maïze and Grain Maïze were studied as substrate for biogas production. Direct and indirect energy use for biogas production is about 44% of net biogas energy production in biogas crop systems, and 26% in biogas production from crop residue. The mean value of GHG emissions is 30 kgCO2.GJ-1 gross biogas production from biogas crops, and 18 kgCO2.GJ-1 gross biogas production from crop residues. Other environmental impacts, although they are not quantified in the present work, are briefly discussed qualitatively.	biogas;france;agricultural
76	Determining the environmental impact of the fuel consumption of agricultural tractors: simulation and comparison. Fuel saving in agricultural machinery is needed for both, limiting the increasingly costly energy demand in agricultural farms and reducing the greenhouse gases emissions of the agriculture sector. Bench tests are conducted on the manufactured machinery to guarantee the delivered power of the engine and control their pollutant emissions comply with current European regulations. At the same time, field experiments are a useful way to document the real use of tractors and actual emissions during agricultural operations. However, the cost of such campaigns is such that the number of machines tested is low, which limits the comparison between different types of equipment. In this paper, a simulation tool is proposed to combine field measurements and bench results in a same database. To do this, force and energy balances are computed for a mechanical system ranging from operator demand to engine characteristics. Numerical results are used to assess pollution and consumption for different field operations. The general driving scenario used in this approach allows a full comparison of the results for different kinds of tractors. The computed greenhouse gas emissions may be used as an environmental indicator of the vehicle performances. However, this index cannot be directly applied to compare the studied tractors that are in fact used for different agricultural practices. Further work is therefore needed to elaborate some scaling factors to compare tractors across the full range of power and use.	agricultural;agricultural tractors;tractors;greenhouse gas emissions
77	Mixed forests: a strategy to face energy and climate issues?. Mixing tree species within a forest stand is a strategy that may have several advantages in terms of timber productivity. This strategy may have a positive effect on productivity and could limit the consequences of the weakening or disappearance of a species because of climate change. Nevertheless, the link between productivity and mixture is complex and depends on a set of factors that vary in space and time. Using data from the National Forest Inventory and long-term experiments are two complementary approaches to improve our knowledge on the functioning of mixed forests and to be able to define management strategies adapted to the different kinds of species assemblages and for different climatic conditions.	productivity;climate change
78	"A national network of comparative trials for testing French Douglas-fir seed orchards. The recent release of six new Douglas fir seed orchard varieties has motivated the establishment of a network of comparative plantations including the eight French Douglas fir orchards. It aims at studying improved variety plasticity and performances (growth, form) in comparison with a control from the natural range. Altogether, 27 evaluation and demonstration projects were planted between 2009 and 2011 at a large range of sites: regions where Douglas fir is widely cultivated, altitude zones and ""climatic margins"". This network will enable the partners (Cemagref, ONF, INRA, CNPF) to provide reforestation workers with recommendations. Useful information has already been obtained for lateness of bud flushing and, therefore on the sensitivity to spring frost damage."	fir orchards
79	A reedbed restoration experiment in a freshwater swamp. A reedbed restoration experiment has been underway in the Grande Brière swamp since 2008 to meet socio-economic and ecological targets. The technical challenge of this experiment consisted in  mechanical mowing with low bearing capacity equipment that respects the site's strong constraints (peat substrate and water cycle). A few months after the experiment, phragmite productivity was found to be at an intermediate level compared to reference reedbeds. The plant biodiversity remained low despite an interesting seed potential while the use of this reedbed by fish fauna was limited during the following spring flooding.	flooding;fish;seed;economic;water
80	"Landemarais peatland restoration : 20 years of monitoring. Resulting from terrestrialization of a pond built in Xth century, the telmatic wetland of Landemarais is an acidic fen-land community, locally differentiated by ombrotrophic bogs. Linked to peat digging, particularly in 1968, the drainage has amplified the woodland dynamics. Integrated within the ENS (""Espaces naturels sensibles"") network of the Conseil Général 35 in 1989, the objectives of peatland restoration were recovering open areas after woodland clearing and peat rewetting. These two actions had to be performed for re-initialisation of natural dynamic trajectories, already existing before disturbances. The targeted species populations and peat plant communities have recovered a steady state close to the reference state (pre-1967). Nevertheless the managers have to face the woody species encroachment, such as Betula and Salix, by cutting and / or digging them every 2-4 years in order to maintain open habitats for conservation of the peatland target species and plant communities. A hypothesis of sod-cutting of the upper peat after woodland clearing is discussed."	peatland restoration
81	Which indicators and technological solutions are adapted to finely assess the energy performance of farms?. This paper is focused on the study of both, methodological and technological solutions to assess energetic performances of farms at the field or operation level. Based on a study of existing energy diagnostics and farming operations, new energy performance indicators adapted to the different spatial and temporal scales considered are put forward. The implementation of the indicators asks raises the questions about the technological availability of solutions to measure, to collect and to store data needed data for their calculation at a reasonable cost for the farmer.	
82	"A specific fuel for agricultural machinery: study of four agricultural biofuel production chains. Fuel has become indespensable to agriculture: it represents 30% of the hourly cost of a tractor and raises the problem of the ""energy fragility"" of modern agriculture, entirely dependent on oil supplies and too sensitive to fuel market prices. With the planned reduction of oil resources, this paper gives technical, economical and environmental issues related to the choice of a specific agricultural fuel for tractors. Four options are presented dealing with two liquid fuels - pure vegetable oil and ethanol - and two gaseous fuels: syngas and biogas. All have been tested, sometimes for several years in the 80s. For each of them, the production process is described. The energy potential and environmental assessment is then evaluated. Three of them are immediately applicable to agricultural machinery and have significant potential for fossil fuel substitution."	agricultural;agricultural biofuel;fragility
83	Case study: state of the polymeric geosynthetic barrier in the “El Golfo” water reservoir on the island of El Hierro (Canary Islands). In 1995 the water reservoir named “El Golfo” (Spain) was built and waterproofed with a synthetic rubber geomembrane of Ethylene-Propylene-Diene terpolymer (EPDM). The Central Laboratory of Structures and Materials CEDEX has tested the initial properties of the geomembrane that served as a basis to evaluate the membrane’s durability. This article presents the behaviour of this geomembrane over twelve years. Periodically, samples were taken and tested as follows: tensile strength, elongation at break, tensile strength at 300% of elongation, Shore-A hardness, static and dynamic puncture resistance, foldability at low temperature, shear and peel resistance of seams, optical and electron microscopy. The encouraging results show a good state of conservation of the geomembrane in the face of climatic hazards.	rubber;el hierro;el golfo;golfo;canary islands
84	Use of geomembranes in dams: 50 years of different applications around the world. In almost 300 dams worldwide, geomembranes are the main waterproofing component. The geomembrane is generally associated with other geosynthetics performing various functions. In this paper, uses of geomembranes in the various types of dams are reviewed. The types of dams reviewed include: embankment dams (earth and rockfill dams), concrete and masonry dams, and roller-compacted concrete (RCC) dams. Design and construction aspects are considered, as well as the selection of geomembranes and their performance (including seepage control and durability). The paper is illustrated using examples of new dams and rehabilitation of existing dams.	
85	Long term hydraulic performance of oxidized exposed and covered bituminous geomembranes. This paper presents the results of a study aiming at quantifying the evolution of water flow rates through oxidized bituminous geomembranes, uncovered or covered. The flow rate was measured with the experimental device from the NF EN 14150 standard, adapted in some cases for flow measurement. Variable results were obtained depending on the presence or absence of a protection on the geomembrane and on the exposure conditions. The recommendation arising from the results obtained is to cover oxidized bituminous geomembranes in order to ensure a good hydraulic performance of these materials in the long term.	evolution;water;hydraulic
86	Ageing of filter geotextiles in drainage works – monitoring of the Roissard experimental draining trenches. The risks related to geofilters ageing used in drainage are a major issue in the context of landslide stabilization engineering as well as dam and dike design. The “DrainAgeing” project aims to better understand and prevent the ageing and clogging of drains. This paper presents the progress of the project and the results of 17 some years of monitoring of the Roissard experimental draining trenches. We conclude on the perspectives for the implementation of a second phase of the project consisting in the excavation and the analysis of samples of geotextiles and geomaterials.	drainage;filter
87	Structural health monitoring of earthen and hydraulic structures with a monitoring and early warning fiber optics system. To assess the safety of an earthen structure, it is essential to have and be able to interpret monitoring data, but the measurements are sometimes difficult to implement and not always reliable over the long term. By inserting optical fibers into a geotextile, the TenCate GeoDetect® solution is the first monitoring system designed specifically for geotechnical applications. Successfully implemented for the past eight years on numerous structures, it provides access to information that was previously very difficult to obtain with great precision. The monitoring solution is based on geotextile and fibre optics composite sensors, to measure both, strain and temperature in earthen and hydraulic structures. It is very accurate as the detection thresholds are lower than 0.02 % and 0.1°C, respectively, whether on localized works or on long linear infrastructures of several tens of kilometres. It has been used for more than 6 years on many walls, piled embankments or with risk of cavities, basins, landfills and dykes.	
88	The DURAGEOS project - Durability of geosynthetics used in landfills. The DURAGEOS project studies the ageing mechanisms of geosynthetics (HDPE geomembranes and GCLs) in non-hazardous waste landfill facilities under the combined action of mechanical stresses, microorganisms and/or oxygen in connection with mass transfer. The physico-chemical and mechanical features of model and commercial geosynthetics aged in the laboratory allow the development of a kinetic model of prediction of the lifetime coupled to a model of material transfer. As part of this project, the models will be validated through geosynthetics sampled on landfill sites. Ecotoxicological risks and external environmental costs will be assessed.	
89	Evaluation of HDPE geomembranes protection against puncturing. Geotextiles are used in the waterproofing of non-hazardous waste landfill facilities lining systems in order to protect the geomembrane against puncturing effects during the installation of the granular drainage layer and then, in service, in relation to the weight of waste. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the performance of nonwoven needlepunched geotextiles having an average mass per unit area equal to 1000 g/m² in protecting geomembranes, based on static puncture tests performed in 1m diameter cells. Aufrère et al. (2009) previously developed these tests. Recommendations are given in the following in terms of fibre length, the modulus of elasticity, mass per unit area and thickness of the geotextile depending on the nature of granular material used.	
90	Performance of a geosynthetic clay liner in a landfill cover after six years in service. Six geosynthetic clay liner (GCL) samples were excavated from the cover of a landfill site closed since 2002 in order to analyse if an evolution of the chemical and hydraulic properties of the GCL had occurred after 6 years in service. This verification was motivated by an important increase in leachate production. Results obtained on the GCL show a poor hydraulic behaviour in relation with a low confining stress, cation exchange and the presence of cracks in the bentonite. This evolution can be explained by the thinness of the covering soil and the cationic exchanges. These results are consistent with previous findings in the literature. With the actual properties measured on the sample, an overall water balance was calculated and helps explaining the increased production of leachate as well as extending the results to the entire cover of the site.	water;clay
91	Experimental evaluation of the biological clogging of a drainage geocomposite at the botom of a landfill. This paper presents a study of the biological clogging potential of drainage geocomposites installed at the bottom of landfills, as a replacement for 0.20 cm of granular drainage material. In the first section of the document, the drainage capacity actually needed is analyzed with respect to the biological clogging potential. The general principles governing experimental evaluation of biological clogging are presented in a second step. The apparatus used to conduct the evaluation is then presented, along with the results obtained after several months of monitoring. The results presented involved circulation of a fresh leachate, pumped in a class 2, non-hazardous landfill into 9 cells, and monitoring of the flow through the system (either a geocomposites or a granular drainage layer).	drainage
92	Risk assessment for leakage from a heap leach pad mulitlayer barrier: joint treatment of aleatory and epistemic uncertainties. There is a shift in the mining industry towards an increased use of risk assessment at the various stages of a mining project. This applies also to the use of geosynthetics in mining applications, e.g. in heap leach pads. Risk assessments use models that involve parameters often affected by uncertainty. In this paper we propose a risk assessment for leakage from a heap leach pad multilayer liner, taking into account two distinct types of uncertainties: random (reflecting variability) and epistemic (reflecting the incomplete nature of available information). It is shown how these distinct types of uncertainties can be taken into account in the estimation of risk, in order to contribute more consistently to the decision-making process.	
93	Geosynthetics for road pavements: European experiences. Geosynthetic reinforcement has been used in road pavement, both in the unbound granular layers and in the overlay, in Europe for more than 40 years. Despite good experience feedback from the field, technically sound design methods and methods for the verification of the effect in the field are still missing. Recommendations for use in road pavement layers are also largely missing in national guidelines. Based on the experiences from a large number of projects, the SINTEF (Foundation for Scientific and Industrial Research located in Norway) has prepared a proposal for guidelines for the use of geosynthetics for the reinforcement in road pavements, both in granular materials and in asphalt overlays. The guidelines give recommendations on the use of geosynthetic reinforcement in roads, based on an evaluation of type of deterioration mechanisms and possible effects.	design;europe;pavement

95	Invasive introduced species: challenging the ecological paradigms. As a result of strong human pressure on aquatic and semiaquatic ecosystems, new species introduced from several parts of the World are increasingly observed. Some of these species become invasive and can threaten biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. This paper is an attempt to disentangle scientific facts or theories from conventional wisdom based on subjective perception or cultural clichés that present invasive introduced species in an essentially negative light Especially, we point out that in the face of a real threat for biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, invasive species may have positive effects or uses. Several issues in invasion management are examined. While characteristics of invasive species cannot easily be predicted, many invasions take place in previously modified ecosystems. Furthermore, invader eradication is not always the best answer for targeting self-sustainable healthy ecosystems. Since exotic species will irrevocably increase in proportion within our ecological communities in the near future, one might as well be ready to adapt to this novel biodiversity by accepting or managing the presence of some invaders.	biodiversity
96	Biological invasions in the natural regional reserve of Brière: applied research for management. The Marshes of Brivet and Brière, located to the north of the Loire estuary, cover 20.500 ha included in the network of Natura 2000 sites and mainly located within the regional nature park of Brière (49 000ha). Among the pressures exerted on the conservation of biodiversity and uses, biological invasions are not a new phenomenon but one that has intensified over tha past in two decades and is currently regarded as a major problem. For the manager, the success of control - and even more so the eradication - of an introduced species depends on a complex implementation of human, financial, scientific and technical means largely exceeding the territorial limits… and seldom  combined. However, the mono-specific approach is confronted with the multiplication of invasive, animal and plant species, which increases the costs while the manager is faced with limited means. The field manager must take into account profound ecosystemic changes, where interspecific relationships between introduced-native but also introduced-introduced species are being established; he then solicits the scientists. In collaboration, scientists and managers analyse the situation and experiment in order to pass from the complex management of invasives to the management of the complex of the invasives.	research
97	"Organization of the management of invasive introduced plants in lakes and coastal ponds in the Landes. Confronted for more than two decades with problems of managing the proliferation of various invasive aquatic plant species, the Géolandes joint association is today a reference in terms of the intervention policy defined at the outset and regularly evaluated and amended to take account of developments and assessments. Four main axes still structure this policy today: heavy corrective work, regular preventive monitoring, training and information and as well as user mobilization.
The joint association provides technical assistance to a system made up of referents present on each of the water bodies. They monitor the situation (annual diagnosis), propose and supervise maintenance operations, and control the disposal of extracted plants. This mobilization is supported by the financial commitment of the association to pay for part of the monitoring and maintenance activities. It should be noted that the strategy developed for invasive species has quickly allowed native species to be taken into account, particularly heritage species.

98	"The networks of the Pays de la Loire region 

. In an attempt to optimize the operations of grubbing-up and management of invasive introduced species engaged for many years in the region of Pays de la Loire, a network of actors was set up by the DREAL (French Regional Department of the Environment, Planning and Housing) in 2001. This network is operates at the regional level with a committee led by the DREAL and at departmental level. The departmental steering is generally provided by the general council and the federation for fishing and the protection of the aquatic environment. This organization in networks allows it to produce reference documentation (e.g. technical guide, bibliographic synthesis), a an up-to-date map of the state of the proliferation, communication documents as well as scientific and methodological support for to managers.Within this partnership framework two working methods are preferred. Early detection is implemented in order to intervene as quickly as possible as soon as an outbreak occurs (eg in the  Loire-Atlantique deparmtment with the management of Crassula helmsii or swamp stonecrop). Prevention and the search for alternative or complementary solutions to grubbing-up  make it possible to intervene in addition to or instead of expensive and repetitive grubbing-up operations (eg in the Loire-Atlantique department with the restoration of the Tressé pike spawning ground ."	
99	"The management of invasive crayfish in the Vosges department. Since the end of the XIXth century, the distribution of crayfish in France has gone through profound upheavals, and the introduction of allochtonous crayfish, essentially from the North American continent, has forever changed the French and European crayfish landscape. The four national surveys on the distribution of crayfish in France carried out by the National Office for Water and Aquatic Enbiornment (ONEMA) since 1977 allow following the evolution of the different species of crayfish present on the national territory, showing each time the considerable expansion of the introduced species and the decline of the native species. The situation of the three native crayfish species must now be considered alarming. The situation of the three native crayfish species must now be considered alarming. Two of these species, Austropotamobius torrentium and Astacus astacus, are close to extinction while the third one, Austropotamobius pallipes, is ""taking refuge"" in the upmost parts of the watersheds. Pacifastacus leniusculus (signal crayfish) and Procamabrus clarkii (Louisana crawfish) are showing the strongest geographical expansion. Everywhere they appear to be very strong competitors, more aggressive, resistant to pathologies, able to colonize varied environments. Thereby eliminating native species. The pace of the illegal introductions seems to accelerate because new species, native of the American continent, have recently been discovered: Orconectes juvenilis in the department of the Doubs and Orconectes immunis in the departement of the Bas-Rhin. In terms of management of these species, the actions are rather rare at the national level. However, in the Vosges department, specific actions are being experimented, in particular with the owners of ponds to try to fight against the expansion of introduced crawfish and thus to protect the last populations of native crawfish."	france;crayfish;crayfish species;invasive crayfish
100	"The bullfrog in Sologne, from fight to eradication. The bullfrog, a species from North America, has been introduced in many countries. In Sologne, this invasive introduced species is creating imbalances in aquatic ecosystems colonized because of its diet, the disease it transmits to other amphibians and the absence of natural predators. Since its discovery in 2002, actions have been undertaken by the Beuvron Basin Maintenance Association, the Departmental Committee for the Protection of Nature and the Environment and the National Office for Hunting and Wildlife in order to eliminate the bullfrog in Sologne. After eight years of combat, we see a significant decrease in the average weight of adults and a reduction in breeding numbers per colonized site. In 2011, volunteers participated in the operations and we tested a novel method for detecting the species in the water, ""environmental"" DNA. This intensification of actions is part of the biodiversity conservation of the Natura 2000 Sologne site."	environment
101	Preventive measures and early detection are needed to manage invasive introduced species. It is quite difficult to eradicate an invasive introduced species when it has begun to spread. Even containment is very complicated, expensive and may be harmful for natural ecosystems. For these reasons, it is necessary to improve prevention in order to combat future invasions. The creation of a national list prioritizing negative impacts and specifying restrictive measures (black list) would be a coherent step towards improving the current legislation and the nation could take a step towards prevention. In the same way, voluntary approaches and participative initiatives can be developed as has already been done for several years with various stakeholders. Finally, the impossibility to master the knowledge of incoming species, setting up surveillance networks is essential. These networks are useful for a better detection of newly established species, but they must also facilitate rapid responses to control emerging populations of undesirable invaders. In order to optimize these networks, early detection areas have to be targeted and specific tools must be developed. This new strategy also implies a better targeting and training of the stakeholders who will support it.	populations
102	Protocols for prioritizing invasive plants with a view to their management: state of the art  and possible improvements in France . Risk assessment is an essential tool for the control of invasive species. It allows to qualify the risk and define preventive measures to be put in place. Regional, national or international lists of invasive species can be produced. The process can be more or less long, depending on the objectives sought. There are two ways to perform a risk assessment: a Phytosanitary Risk Analysis (PRA) which is very lengthy but is accepted by the World Trade Organization (WTO) and can consequently provide a legal ban on the sale of certain species for the whole Europe, and other much shorter methods that are sometime more suitable for nature conservation or land settlement. Several agencies under the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of the Environment (MAAPRAT and MEDDTL) have developed hierarchical lists of invasive species using different assessment processes. These lists divide species into categories that distinguish those that are most harmful and those with more moderate and low impacts. The aim of the study is to find one or several methods to determine priorities for national and regional control programs. Two approaches have been tested here and compared with previous studies: the “EPPO Prioritization Process » (EPPO = European Plant Protection Organization) which can be used in over 50 European countries and which has been tested here for France, and the prioritization process developed by Weber & Gut, is - able to rank species and very simple to perform - which has been tested for the Mediterranean part of France and also used in comparison with the EPPO process for the whole country. Over 370 species were assessed for the MAAPRAT. The EPPO prioritization process identified about 30 species, which should be targeted for priority prevention measures. The results from the Weber process are consistent with these results. Over 70 species have been tested for the MEDDTL, the results are in line with the experts' opinion and the score allows to order and prioritize the species and to better take into account the impacts of these species on ecosystems.	france;invasive species;art
103	Environnemental DNA: a methodological jump for biodiversity surveys. Living organisms leave DNA fragments in their environment. Molecular biology tools allow amplifying specific DNA fragments. As a result it is possible to perform biodiversity surveys based on samples (water, soil, etc.) containing DNA fragments (called DNAe for environmental DNA) identified as belonging to a species. This method was used for the first time in France to carry out an inventory of the invasive American Bullfrog, Lithobates catesbeianus, as part of an eradication program. The results show a much higher efficiency of this new method to detect the species at sites where it is present at low densities. The DNAe method was also used in North America to detect Asian carps - which are invasive - in the Chicago canals. The method proved again to be very sensitive and more efficient than conventional methods (electrofishing). There are still methodological developments to be consolidated, but the potential of the DNAe method for biodiversity surveys and early detection of invasive species should be swiftly demonstrated in studies where it is currently used (e.g. aquatic mammals, crayfishes, amphibians, fishes).	dna;jump
104	Contributions of economics to the management of invasive species: the case of the common slipper-limpet in the bay of St-Brieuc. This paper examines the contributions of economic science to the management of invasive introduced species as decision support. Starting from the case study of the invasion of the scallop fishery in the Bay of Saint-Brieuc by the common slipper limpet (Crepidula fornicata), an invasive species present in the Bay of Saint-Brieuc, we will illustrate the three areas of intervention in which economic science can shed light on the decision-making process for the management of invasive species: assessment of the costs of damage, identification of a so-called optimal management policy and incentive measures to correct the risk factors for the proliferation or introduction of invasive species. The more general contributions of economics are then discussed.	invasive species;invasive introduced species
105	The management of invasive introduced species: from the search for a technical solution to the construction of a community. For many managers of natural areas, the consideration of invasive introduced species is primarily a technical issue. However, approaches in the human and social sciences, concerned both, with the perceptions of these species and with the category of introduced invasive species themselves, have emphasized how the technical choices depended on socio-cultural factors. In addition, these species which can spread by different means, require coordination between a variety of stakeholders and territories. Their management thus calls for the establishment of a collective involving all stakeholders, be they scientists, managers or users.	invasive species;invasive introduced species
106	Removal of priority and emerging substances by wastewater treatment plants. Sewage treatment plants were not designed for removing micropollutants. They do, however, remove a significant amount of them, mainly by adsorption on biological sludge associated with biological degradation for certain substances.

The acquisition of the knowledge needed to improve the design, sizing and operation of fast-developing processes such as membrane bioreactors, biofilters, moving bed biofilm reactors (MBBRs) and soon the IFAs (integrated fixed-film activated sludge) process is an emblematic activity of Cemagref's scientific teams. The work is carried out within the framework of industrial partnerships or by associating them with mainly public funding and in conjunction with targeted higher education institutions. Observations and experiments over long periods carried out on site are coupled with research work carried out under controlled conditions on a pilot scale. They have notably led to the dynamic modelling of the functioning of each of these treatment chains. This article presents as an example the case of moving bed biofilm reactors, also called MBBRs.	modeling
108	"Constructed wetlands: history and current trends. Although the use of plants in sanitation is relatively old, the development of controlled techniques is much more recent. Constructed wetlands , which have been studied in France for about thirty years, have undergone significant development due to technical factors (e.g. reliability of performance, robustness of the system, easy maintenance) and, to some extent, a ""green"" trend. Since the development of the sector and the rapid changes that are currently taking place, research has evolved considerably. From a pragmatic analysis of systems and trial-and-error type studies, research, thanks also to the evolution of metrology, has moved from a deterministic approach to specify the mechanisms, and nowadays, to a mechanistic approach through the creation of complex dynamic models. This evolution of research has made it possible to provide practical solutions to a strong societal demand to make systems evolve towards greater performance or to widen the fields of application of constructed wetlands."	wetlands;evolution;research
109	Asset management of sewerage systems: the Indigau and GompitZ tools, from the state of the sewerage networks to the planning of their rehabilitation. Asset management of sewerage systems is a growing concern for network managers. A buried asset, it is often misunderstood. Although it has a relatively long lifespan, some networks are beginning to date now, raising fears of large and costly renewal needs for the decades to come. This paper introduces two complementary models, Indigau and GompitZ, issued from projects in which various research teams, network managers and consultants have worked. Initiated in the European project CARE-S (Computed Aided Rehabilitation of Sewer networks), between 2002 and 2005, and the national RERAU project (rehabilitation of urban sewerage networks) between 2000 and 2004), both models are based on closed circuit television inspection data (CCTV) to describe the network status and pipe environment data. Indigau proposes a prioritization tool to rehabilitate sections in the short term, it is a tool based on multiple criteria and taking into account data on malfunctions and socio-economic criteria for the impact of failures. GompitZ allows long-term simulations, designed on a probabilistic modeling, and statistically based on CCTV data and pipe characteristics; coupled with a collector sensitivity model in the ROCA tool developed by Lyonnaise des Eaux, it enables to simulate the long-term effect of rehabilitating the most at-risk sections. The implementation of these models on the Caen and Bordeaux networks is described. 	sewerage;television;cctv

The International Water Association (IWA) Task Group on Good Modelling Practice (GMP) has analysed current practices and experiences in the use of activated sludge models. The group developed a framework to make modelling more straightforward and that helps structuring the interaction between modellers and the project stakeholders. The GMP protocol is a synthesis of existing procedures and contains five major steps: (i) Project definition, (ii) Data collection and analysis, (iii) Construction and evaluation of the wastewater treatment plant model, (iv) Calibration and validation, and (v) Simulation and result interpretation.  The Unified Protocol forms the basis of a Scientific and Technical Report that will be published in late 2012.	modeling;international water association

Life cycle assessment (LCA) is increasingly positioning itself as a decision-making tool for the choice of treatment options and their technical management in synergy with more local approaches such as impact or risk studies. The article summarizes the LCA results obtained in small and medium-sized communities for very low load activated sludge treatment plants and reed filters. It then analyzes the sewerage system as a whole by presenting the contributions to the various environmental impacts of the plant and the collection system. Finally, it outlines the prospects, in particular with regard to a better consideration of the LCA of pathogens and micropollutants, in order to better evaluate ""tertiary"" treatments. In addition, educational inserts will detail the LCA method with a focus on certain categories of impacts such as eutrophication or ecotoxicity."	life cycle
113	Marquopoleau: a toolbox to differentiate the origin of fecal contamination in surface waters. A toolbox has been developed to distinguish three major sources of contamination of bathing water in Brittany: human, cattle and pig faeces. It consists of chemical markers (caffeine and stanols) and of microbiological markers (bacteriophages and bacteria). Their persistences were compared to that of E. coli and enterococci in fresh and marine waters contaminated by faecal pollution. The application of the toolbox on a small agricultural catchment in Brittany for one year confirmed the relevance of using this tool to differentiate human and animal sources of fecal pollution in natural waters.	brittany;water
114	Water consumption in France: history, contemporary trends, determinants. While household water consumption in France was increasing steadily before the 1990s, it then began to stabilize and then decline. The purpose of this article is first to describe past and contemporary trends in this phenomenon. This will be illustrated by concrete cases, notably that of the Nantes Metropolis. Secondly, we will try to explain the trends observed by seeking to understand the main determinants of water consumption: e.g. demographic, climatic, economic and socio-cultural factors.	water;france

Contrary to popular belief, the water distributed by public systems is not the only water available to users to meet their needs. One can even observe that in some cases the downward trend in the system's water consumption can be partly explained by the use of ""alternative water"" to rather than water from the public system: drilling, rainwater harvesting, connection to a raw water distribution system. This article first focuses on the economic reasoning behind such behaviour. It then illustrates this problem by taking as an example the weight of individual drillings carried out in the Roussillon aquifer. Finally, it criticizes this phenomenon by presenting the consequences of this type of access on the community as a whole."	water
116	Does irrigation decrease in France? First insights from the 2010 agricultural census. The analysis of the 2010 agricultural census data provides an overview of the current situation of irrigation in France and the main evolutions since 2000. Despite an apparent stability of the irrigated area, due to a 2010 dry spring requiring unusually high irrigation levels, we highlight, for the first time in 40 years, a reduction in the irrigable area (i.e. the area that can be irrigated). This reduction mainly concerns the South of France and areas irrigated by collective irrigation systems. The orientations of the Common Agricultural Policy, the progressive implementation of the Water Framework Directive and an economic context more favorable to rainfed crops compared to irrigated ones are the main factores explaining this irrigation decrease. We highlight that these evolutions risk however complicating water management both at the watershed level and at the collective irrigation system level.	irrigation;water;agricultural;france
117	Subsurface drip irrigation: an innovative solution to irrigate under restrictive water conditions. The implementation of innovative irrigation techniques such as subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) is the solution adopted by most countries facing water scarcity problems due to its very good efficiency. As more and more regions in France are subject to restrictive water usage, its possible use to irrigate field crops is on the agenda. The underground drip technique was introduced in the USA more than two decades ago (Camp, 1998). However, the materials used, generally made of porous pipes, were not very efficient because they were very vulnerable to clogging and root intrusion. This was confirmed by trials conducted in Montpellier at the end of the 1980s. The appearance of new materials reputed to be more efficient prompted Irstea to carry out experiments to analyse their possible application in the context of field crops such as maize when subjected to restrictive water pipes.	water;irrigation
118	"Hydraulic and energy efficiency: the new performance criteria for future irrigation systems. In order to evaluate modern irrigation systems performances, productivity and economic profitability are the main criteria used, even if robustness and flexibility of the equipment are also taken into account. However, with the increasing tension on the resources, there is a growing interest in indicators taking into account water and energy factors. Available data are not sufficiently representative for a very detailed analysis of hydraulic and energetic efficiency; however, it is possible to give some some orders of magnitude. Regarding water efficiency, the reasons of losses or wastage are numerous; they may be related to lack of maintenance, to obsolete equipment or to the conditions under which the material is used. Regarding energy efficiency, the sizing of pumping stations is generally the most important point; but there is also certain margin of progress with the choice of equipment or their mode of functioning. Some energetic and hydraulic performance diagnostics in irrigation would improve the situation, but it is also useful to acquire more references in order to better understand the ""water"" and ""energy"" footprint of agricultural production."	efficiency;water efficiency;water;energy efficiency;irrigation;hydraulic

After a historical overview of irrigation canals, their strategic importance and recent trends, we define more precisely the free surface hydraulic systems we analyse in this article. We present their features that make their management difficult but essential. We then define more precisely what we call ""management"", with different nuances, including operational management, and we use concepts from production management to better analyze it. Finally, we detail one of these concepts namely the ""devices"" used to implement the operational management."	irrigation canals;water
120	Modernization of irrigation canals: the contribution of automation to operational management. Traditional manual operation of irrigation canals has led to the development of agriculture for millennia, using the technologies available at that time. Currently, the performance of these traditional canals can no longer meet the new challenges of irrigation schemes, both in terms of available resources and of their its uses. Automation is currently one of the elements enabling to cope with these new challenges. This article discusses the limitations associated with manual operation and the benefits of automation. These benefits are explained on two aspects: water saving and improving the quality of water distribution. Finally, information is given on the various possible approaches to automating a canal.	canals;water;irrigation canals;irrigation;agriculture
121	Supervision for the management and regulation of canals and rivers. In order to improve management efficiency and the flexibility left to the users, more and more use is being made of automatic control of canals and rivers. To manage this type of complex process, the industry has been using supervision systems since the 1960s. The purpose of supervision is to acquire data to manage an industrial process manually or automatically. Software and hardware evolutions and the reduction of costs mean that their use is no longer reserved for large systems. This note presents the main concepts related to supervision systems.	canals;rivers
122	Hydraulic flushes to manage algal communities in canals. Hydraulic control can be used to control algal communities, which are likely to cause physical disturbances in canals, or even to deteriorate the water quality. Here we present original management strategies implemented on two real irrigation canal networks. These strategies consist of regular flushes in order to cut-off fixed algae. During a flush, canal control methods are used in real-time to control the turbidity generated by the entrainment of the fixed matter.	canals;canal control;hydraulic control;hydraulic
123	Agricultural water demand and its economic valorisation in the territories: an assessment that is only possible using a participatory approach. In order to face the drastic challenges appearing in watersheds with quantitative imbalances, the mobilisation of all stakeholders is necessary in order to envisage a sustainable management of water resources. However, only a participatory approach can lead to a shared diagnosis of the current situation based on a rigorous characterisation of water withdrawals and their valorisation through irrigation and to jointly build viable alternatives for water management from both an economic and social point of view. The proposed approach has been implemented in several territories, notably in the Drôme, Beauce and Alpes de Haute Provence departments. It is based on a method based on the participation of stakeholders to mobilise operational technico-economic modelling, using a crop model and an economic simulator and all the necessary information at the farm and territorial levels.	water;agricultural water;irrigation
124	A simulation tool for water resources management on a territory as part of a participatory process. This paper presents a simulation tool adapted to water resources management on a territorial scale, as part of a participatory process. This tool combines the PILOTE-TER crop model and the Olympe technico-economical simulator. PILOTE-TER integrages the crop model Pilote developed by Irstea (the French National Research Institute of Science and Technology for Environment and Agriculture) with a database managed through a graphical interface. It allows the use of the Pilote model to evaluate water demand and crop yield at the scale of the field, the farm and the territory. The parameters of the model are based on the results of experiments performed by Irstea. PILOTE-TER is coupled with the technico-economic simulator Olympe (developed by INRA, the French national institute for agricultural research) to produce economical indicators. These tools are used for a territorial representation of agriculture build with local stakeholders, allowing the comparison of several scenarios (based on economical, policy or climate changes).	water;agriculture;environment;agricultural research;pilote ter
125	What are the mechanisms for regulating groundwater withdrawals? Comparison from the point of view of farmers, institutions and citizens. In this paper, we analyse stakeholder perceptions of three groundwater regulation policy scenarios, which assume a strengthening of regulatory intervention, the implementation of community-based management or the creation of a system of transferable water rights. The method consists in organizing foresight workshops with institutional representatives and farmers in a southern France case study, as well as mini-debates with lay citizens outside the study area. From a methodological viewpoint, the research demonstrates the ability of farmers and citizens to contribute to an exploratory assessment of water management scenarios considered. From a policy viewpoint it clarifies expectations concerning public intervention and self-regulation. It also provides some insights regarding the acceptability of tradable groundwater permits in two European contexts.	water;farmers
126	Assessing services supplied by irrigation systems: the case of groundwater recharge. Surface irrigation associations in Southern France frequently face difficulties to ensure their infrastructure's durability and to provide a satisfying irrigation service. Besides, these systems also provide additional services, for which they rarely receive any remuneration. This paper studies a method for assessing the economic value of externalities produced by these irrigation systems, in order to estimate their potential exchange value.  It is in line with the will to take these services into account in order to integrate them into local land use planning policies and, thereby, to ensure the durability of such irrigation systems. The method is applied to groundwater recharge by the Corbère surface irrigation system (Pyrénées Orientales, France). As a result, we propose a range of values within which a payment for these services could be negotiated between the suppliers (irrigation associations) and the beneficiaries.	irrigation;france
127	An uncertain future for water user association for irrigation in France . This article discusses the conditions for the sustainable management of irrigation schemes by users' associations, through the analysis of the conditions for the longevity of French Authorised Syndicated Associations (ASA). We first present five of the most important principles of their old legal and administrative framework born of a desire to control the future of the ASAs by public authorities and then illustrate how these principles allow ASAs to conform to most of the sustainable principles highlighted in institutional economy, in particular by E. Ostrom (1990) following several monographs on jointly managed assets . In the third part, we will point out the limits of these design principles regarding replacement of infrastructures, maintenance and adaptation to social changes and question the future of these WUA inlight of the latest public policies and agricultural statistics.	irrigation;france;agricultural;water
128	With their special status, what roles for the Regional Development Companies in water policies and especially irrigation?. Regional development companies (SAR), regional water management operators with regional land use planning mandates, have in France an special status of business corporations. They play a major role in making the necessary investments in irrigation in the South of France. The relationship with irrigators is based on private law contracts generally involving measurement of the quantities of water distributed and special attention to the water price. The sale of water to different agricultural, urban or industrial users makes it possible to balance the accounts. As these companies to provide the State with the guarantee of structured organizations, the distribution of water, and the creation of resource before the equipment of farms, the State Council recommends to give them more weight.	water;irrigation;france
129	Anaerobic digestion in the agricultural sector: an overview of the Italian scenario. Anaerobic digestion of livestock effluents, energy crops, and agro-waste is a widespread practice at farm level in Italy. Since high subsidies are granted for the production of renewable energy in this specific sector are granted (280 € per MWh for plants below 1 MW, energy crops are the main (and sometime sole) feedstock for anaerobic digesters. This largely determines the use of land, water and fertilizers, which is not sustainable on a long-term perspective. Moreover, beside carbon (which can be converted to energy), these materials also introduce considerable amounts of nitrogen in the anaerobic digesters. This can limit the agricultural use of the digestate, especially in Nitrate Vulnerable Zones (NVZ). However, the introduction of these considerable subsidies for renewable energy production allows for the application of a number of different technological solutions for nitrogen management. The subsidy system will be changed soon and smaller size will be favored. Also, small plants treating livestock effluents as sole substrates will be economically favoured.	agricultural;italy;livestock
130	Anaerobic digestion development in the West of France. The Pays de la Loire and Brittany regions are the leading regions for animal husbandry in France, with a strong presence of agro-food industries. In view of this, these two regions have a strong potential for the development of anaerobic digestion. The regional climate air energy plans (SRCAE) have looked into this issue. Studies on anaerobic digestion channels have been carried out in this context, and the main data from these studies are presented in this article.	france;climate air energy
131	Spatial analysis to assist in the planning of collective anaerobic digestion projects . Anaerobic digestion is a biological process offering many advantages: (i) energy production from local resources (ii) reduction of greenhouse gas emissions (iii) substitution of fossil energy. In the context of the potential development of collective biogas plants in France, the use of GIS (Geographic Information systems) geolocate the bio-resources appears to be a very interesting and useful tool. Such investigations have already been carried out at both national and regional scales but need to be adapted for local diagnosis. For this purpose, a research project was devoted to the development of such methodologies, then applied to the “Pays de Fougères”, a 1000 km² rural area located in north-eastern Brittany, France. Mapping the potential energy of the territory was established by carrying out an inventory of available resources (livestock manure, crop residues, sewage sludge from wastewater treatment plants, garden waste from drop-off centers, waste from agro-food industries and food wastes waste from school canteens and hospitals). For this purpose, GIS methods have been developed. This study initiates the construction of a GIS model to determine optimal sites for collective biogas plants.	gas emissions
132	Local authorities: a source of organic waste and a way of recovering heat for agricultural methanisation ?. In order to increase profits, all on-farm anaerobic digestion (AD) needs (i) waste with a high capacity to produce methane and (ii) an economic valorization of the heat produced. This article shows that local authorities produce a large amount of organic waste, like waste from restaurants, the organic fraction from household refuse, urban sludge, green algae. Despite this diversity, only few sources can be used for on-farm AD because the waste must have a high methanogenic potential, be sorted, stored within a close distance and have the possibility of payments in royalty fees: those factors are difficult to combine. However, there are examples, evidence of opportunities and margins for progress. At the same time, local authorities have many buildings, which sometimes have very high thermic needs and hot water consumption. The added value of thermic energy produced by anaerobic digestion sometimes faces constraints, such as distance and urban density, which create high costs for heating networks. Opportunities of partnership between on-farm biogas production and local authorities are real but need to be studied on an individual case basis.	
133	The effects and consequences of anaerobic digestion on organic matter and nitrogen in pig slurry. Pig slurry is an abundant resource in terms of mass (around 18 million tonnes produced per year in France). A field experiment carried out on the site of the Guernevez pig station (Chamber of Agriculture of Brittany) made it possible to compare the fate of the main elements of the slurry (carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus) and of two indicator germs of treatment, depending on whether it follows a traditional management method or undergoes a passage through a mesophilic digester. Spontaneous anaerobic digestion in slurry pits causes methane emissions into the atmosphere over the course of months. Passing through a digester accelerates this phenomenon while recovering the biogas emitted. For slurry, only 22% of organic matter is degraded. In terms of energy, the benefit is modest since the pig slurry is a diluted effluent (92 to 96% water) with a limited energy production potential. The addition of 3% by mass of a cookie factory residue has doubled the production of biogas per tonne of input. In this case, more than 90% of the organic matter of the co-substrate has been degraded so that the composition of the digestate differs little from that of the slurry digestate. Regarding nitrogen, there is a slight increase in the ammoniacal fraction (72% for the digestate against 65% for the slurry), but above all a net increase (doubling) of losses by volatilization, both during storage and spreading, correlated with an increase in pH from 7.2 for slurry to 8.2 for digestate. On phosphorus, the effects are insignificant. The dissolved forms are barely more abundant in the digestate and the mineral fractions precipitated in the form of fine particles remain dominant (80%). From an agronomic point of view, in this particular case, the slurry digestates alone or mixed with the by-product of the agro-food industry have characteristics similar to those of raw slurry after storage, apart from the increased risks of ammonia volatilization mentioned above. Their use for fertilizing maize did not give rise to significant differences in yields or in nitrous oxide emissions. Some differences in the kinetics of organic nitrogen and carbon mineralization were however observed.	pig
134	Using life cycle assessment to determine the environmental interest of the treatment of organic effluents by anaerobic digestion with regard to territorial constraints . The management of organic waste is a territorial issue and especially in Brittany because of the existence of nitrogen excess inducing a significant deterioration of surface water used for drinking water production and a green algae bloom on the coast under certain conditions. Collective management of organic waste by anaerobic digestion allowing nitrogen export represents a possible way to locally reduce the nitrogen pollution. In order to provide evidence of the environmental performance of this alternative, a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was carried out for three scenarios on the management of livestock effluent and food industry waste for a watershed in Brittany: a reference scenario representing current practice and two alternative scenarios with a post-treatment of the composting allowing the use of the biogas produced from anaerobic digestion either by a local industry or for an evapo-concentration process. Only three relevant environmental impact categories were assessed: climate change, acidification and eutrophication. The scenario with composting highlights the interest of biogas recovery. The scenario with evapo-concentration is the least impacting but leads to a potential impact transfer for eutrophication, due to the export of a significant amount of nitrogen out of the studied watershed. LCA is insightful for collective thinking but also opens the debate on these complex territories that watersheds are: should we favour a local collaboration to move towards industrial ecology and probably facilitated social acceptance, or encourage the reduction of the nitrogen pressure into a watershed in litigation?	water;climate change;environmental interest;life cycle;watershed;algae;brittany;organic
135	Macrophytes, partners or competitors?. Apart from the large waterside helophytes, which are clearly visible in waterscape, aquatic plants are often unknown to the public. The latter is generally only interested in them when they proliferate and then wishes for them to be gone. For several decades, the investigations carried out on macrophytes and their communities have greatly evolved in line with social demands. From the management of species causing nuisances to the implementation of the Water Framework Directive, we have gone through studies on the ecological functioning of these communities, on the possibilities of direct use of certain species and on need to protect other endangered species. In addition to a chronological analysis of this evolution over nearly 4 decades, a broad overview will be drawn up by reflecting on the relationships established between the public, managers and researchers concerning these ubiquitous constituents of aquatic environments, competitors and partners in human activities.	water;evolution
136	Locating macrophytes from the sky or underwater, what support for managers?. The study of the distribution of macrophytes is essential, whether for knowledge or management purposes. Historically dependent only on field surveys, the acquisition of these data can now rely on new methods based on remote sensing. Whether optical (use of satellite or airborne radiometric measurements) or acoustics (use of sonars or on-board radars), remote sensing can now provide effective technical solutions and provide relevant information through the development of original processing methods. It allows the identification of plant covers and their nature (differentiation of species or types of floating meadows). The data is geolocated precisely through the use of GPS or image geo-referencing systems, thus limiting observer bias. In addition, the instruments used provide access to information for sites that are difficult to access (e.g. wetlands, private land, great depth) and thus limit the human needs and time required. Finally, the development of processing chains makes it possible to have methods that are spatially and temporally reproducible, making the use of these technologies very relevant for, e.g., the monitoring and understanding of colonization processes. The interest of remote sensing for mapping and helping to manage macrophytes is real, but still underutilized.	
137	New weeds in wet meadows: terrestrial forms of invasive Water Primroses (Ludwigia spp.) on meadows. Water Primroses (Ludwigia spp.) are well-known invasive species, because they cause many problems in hydrosystems. However, they are still surprising plants both for managers and scientists regarding their ability to colonize new habitats. For some years now they have been expanding on wet meadows in protected areas. First, the two amphibious species are presented. Then the process of their colonization on meadows and an estimation of the colonized areas are detailed; morphological adaptations of terrestrial forms are analyzed. In the last part, management and mitigation experiences in different contexts underline the difficulty of a corrective management and impose preventive management as much as possible.	water;weeds;wet meadows;protected areas
138	Gestion des jussies dans le Marais Poitevin. The dense hydraulic coverage of the hydrographic network and the virtual absence of summer flow make the Marais Poitevin an area particularly favorable to the development of aquatic plants. During the 1970s, the first plant proliferations included extremely heavy coverings of duckweed and colonization of parts of the main channels by dense floating meadows of submerged species. Over the years, these native species have been partially replaced by exotic species including the Jussies water primroses. After a presentation of the site, the modalities and an assessment of the management put in place since then are presented.	
139	Invasive aquatic plants in the Netherlands. Invasive aquatic plants management in the Netherlands is based simultaneously on improvements in regulations, public information, the establishment of a code of conduct signed by many public and private partners and on appropriate interventions. Examples of experiments on two invasive species, Cabomba caroliniana and Ludwigia peploides, are presented and the results discussed.	netherlands
140	Managing invasive introduced plants in Great Britain. The British love of gardening has resulted in a rich variety of exotic pond and garden plants that are becoming established in the wild throughout the UK. These plants can have a variety of social, economic and environmental impacts.  Some of these species, such as Japanese knotweed Fallopia japonica and Himalayan balsam Impatiens glandulifera were introduced in the mid-nineteenth century and are now widespread across Great Britain. Other species, such as water primrose Ludwigia grandiflora have only been available in cultivation relatively recently and are only just beginning to become established. Our strategy recognises that preventing these invasions, by public education and restricting the supply of invasive species, provides the most cost-effective means of management. If species do begin to become established in the wild, early intervention will minimise cost and damage.	great britain
141	A European regulation on the management of invasive introduced species: main lines of action and discussion points. A Regulation on « the prevention and the management of the introduction and spread of invasive introduced species » was published 9 September 2013, and has been discussed at the level of the European Parliament and the Council. First, this article aims at presenting this regulation, which aims to mitigate the impacts of invasive introduced species, to harmonize the management of these species at EU level and to develop a preventive management. The provisions it contains will apply to a list of invasive introduced species of concern to the Union and will involve bans and restrictions, management of pathways of introduction, a surveillance system, controls at the Union's borders, rapid response measures and the management of widespread species. Second, we will present the issues that have been debated over the past months, such as the nature of the impact of species on the list, the territories affected by these species and where the provisions will have to apply (all or a part of the Union's territory). We also discuss bans and derogations that have also been debated. This presentation allows an appreciation of the importance and complexity of the national policy to be implemented. 	species;invasive introduced species
142	Removing buttercups from Entraygues sur Truyère: a plant management and human awareness operation. Buttercup floating meadows installed in the Entraygues sur Truyère crossing on the course of the Truyère were considered nuisances to be eliminated. Two techniques for regulating aquatic plant proliferation (uprooting and reworking of the bottom of the river) were tested in 2002 with the implementation of recolonization monitoring until 2005. In view of this experience, it proved illusory to consider that the two techniques applied could have lasting effectiveness. Despite everything, these experiments made it possible to change the perspective of elected officials and those concerned with the management of the floating meadow. The floating meadows have thus gradually passed from the status of a nuisance to that of a seasonal and acceptable element of the landscape.	
143	"Methods based on macrophytes populations to assess the ecological state of aquatic environments. Studying living organisms in aquatic environments in order to obtain information on the conditions prevailing in their environment is the founding idea of the concept of bioindication. The first work in this direction, from the beginning of the 20th century, continued in Europe according to different conceptions and a history specific to each “school” and each biological compartment. Thus, the macrophytes were specifically examined to provide information on the morphodynamics of their habitat and the disturbances linked to the disturbances of the hydrochemical equilibria. With the implementation of the Water Framework Directive (WFD), promulgated in 2000, a new era began for research in the field of bioindication, with more precise methodological prescriptions and a desire for harmonization on a European scale. The ""macrophyte element"" then became the subject of new research and development work presented in this article."	environment;populations;aquatic environments;research
144	Are macrophytes good candidates for evaluation of restoration success? The example of reconnected side-channels of the Rhine river.. Restoration works in the Alsace Rhine floodplain led to reconnect former side arms of the Rhine to the main course. Aquatic plant communities are used as indicators of the success of the restoration, namely the recover of the functionality of alluvial aquatic ecosystems. To test this tool we focussed on the floristic composition of communities, biological traits of species, stocks and flows of diaspores, the explanatory variables, trophic level and hydro- morphological characteristics. This study was conducted at ninerestored sites and three reference sites never disconnected from the main course. Monitoring of these parameters shows that the restored side channels have many similarities with the reference ones, especially for the floristic composition. This is mainly related to the hydro-morphological conditions, and secondarily to the trophic level and the flow of diaspores. The analysis of biological and ecological traits provides additional indices to confirm the restoration of some ecological functions.  Because of their speed of installation, their adaptive strategies developed during the recolonization and their capacity to integrate dynamics of water and nutrients, mycrophytes seem good candidates for evaluating the success of the reconnection of the side arms to the river.	floristic
145	"Macrophytes to clean water?. The capacity of macrophytes to produce organic matter are increasingly used to extract nutrients from domestic wastewater in order to reduce the impacts of partially purified water discharges on the natural environment. Improved knowledge in this area has played an important role in the design of new water treatment systems inspired by natural processes, called «constructed wetlands"". Brix (1993) proposed a classification of the various «constructed wetlands"" according to the types of macrophytes used, i.e. rooted and emergent, rooted and submerged and free-floating on the water surface. After an assessment of the knowledge on the uses of these three types of macrophytes to purify effluents, we will develop a rationale to better clarify the role of plants in purification as well as the constraints induced by their deliberate or involunatry presence. Acting as a support for plant purifying microorganisms, these plants also turn out to be attractive landscape elements. However, the biomass they produce must be regularly exported to allow the sustainable operation of wastewater treatment facilities."	water;wetlands;natural environment
146	Potential for using macrophytes to limit the impact of industries on European aquatic environments. For the achievement of the recommended good chemical and ecological status of European water bodies, macrophytes are good candidates for evaluating as well as reducing ecotoxicity of industrial effluents before release in aquatic environments. On the one hand, these bio-integrators are suitable for estimating the impacts caused by synergies between pollutants and/or the chronicity of discharges. A new biomonitoring tool – the Helophyte Development Index (HDI) – using five macrophytes, has been developed under controlled conditions, on the basis of plant responses to artificial industrial effluents. Unlike most of existing tools, this one uses native species from the concerned aquatic bodies, and does not require any laboratory equipment. It is user-friendly and monitoring can be conducted on-site by a non-specialist. The HDI tool has the potential to be routinely used to check the impact of industrial discharges, but it is first necessary to accumulate in situ data to validate this method under various environmental and contamination conditions. On the other hand, macrophytes are known to be able to accumulate metals in their biomasses and can thus contribute to phytoremediation of industrial effluents. Several exotic hyperaccumulator species have been discovered and research has to be conducted on autochthonous macrophytes from European water bodies in order to pool objectives of phytoremediation and biodiversity conservation.	water;aquatic environments

In the European Union, the “short food supply chains” have become key-components of territorial development strategies. In 2010, a vast inventory of initiatives was carried out in 23 Member States at the request of the EU Committee of the Regions; it shows to what extend they reflect the different choices of organisation and governance at local, regional and national levels, beyond the cultural or geographical diversity. The tools of intervention used illustrated different models of political representations, i.e. neoliberal, traditional-ruralist, alternative-ecologist. These representations allow us to better understand the reach of the proposals and counter-proposals, which have marked the European debate on the agricultural and rural development policy 2014-2020."	food
149	Agriculture and territorial action policy in mountainous areas: mechanisms and governance. The economic, social and environmental issues affecting hill and mountain farming in France may encourage a redefinition of the roles of the stakeholders in the direction of a stronger territorialisation of its management. However, agricultural institutions still hold a dominant position in the sector. Local development plan projects only have few possibilities of action to promote new open and partnership-based forms of governance. Nevertheless, gradually, local actors are succeeding in multiplying small initiatives and are becoming involved in the social and political game around	agriculture;france
150	How can territorial approaches to water management be effective?. The process of implementing approaches linked to the territorialisation of water policy (river contracts; Water Development and Management Plans, or Schémas d’Aménagement et de Gestion des Eaux – SAGE) began thirty years ago. This timeframe provides sufficient historical perspective to examine the contribution of those approaches to preserving and improving the ecological state of hydrosystems, an EU imperative since 2000. As a case study, the management of the River Drôme over the period 1980-2013, at once pioneering and exemplary, facilitates an understanding of both the territorialisation process and the conditions required to ensure the implementation of an effective environmental policy at the local level. The effectiveness of approaches based on territorialisation is associated with the capacities of water managers to use territorial both, to convince, encourage or force users to change practices that damage the aquatic environment, and also to obtain from institutional and financial partners the necessary room for manoeuvre and financial resources required. 	water;environment
151	"LEADER: a mixed and contrasting assessment in terms of added value - Illustration based on the LEADER regional assessment in Auvergne. Introduced by the European community in the early 1990s to remedy the structural development difficulties of rural areas, the LEADER community initiative program has gained ground. Strengthened over the generations, it finally established itself in the landscape of support mechanisms for rural development through its integration into the EAFRD for the period 2007-2013. It is generally presented as a specific intervention mechanism in terms of both its implementation and its original spectrum of intervention (Buller, 2000). With the support of a local decision-making body associating public and private partners (the Local Action Group), it enables the concerted definition of a local transversal development strategy, making it possible to mobilize resources and respond to specific challenges of the territory. Technical and financial support for local actors is planned with the aim of stimulating the implementation of innovative, emerging projects according to a bottom-up logic. In line with its vocation of supporting the sustainable development of the territory, it seeks in particular to support private economic players in order to enable the creation of activities and jobs in rural areas. However, it differs from ""classic"" support mechanisms through the implementation of the development strategy built and backed by the territory. This strategy is reflected in the support of original projects, promoting local resources identified for their correspondence with the founding principles of the program. The difference between ""classic"" support and ""LEADER"" support is what is often referred to as ""LEADER added value"". We highlight the fundamental importance of the coordination of local actors in the implementation of the program at the service of projects ""with an economic purpose"" and in particular its central role in the program’s capacity to express its specificity. We did so through the experience of the regional evaluation of actions to support economic initiatives in LEADER in the Auvergne Region, carried out as part of a wider work on the evaluation of the 2nd pillar of the Common Agricultural Policy. After presenting the Leader program and the evaluation process, the main results of each of the two phases of the evaluation will be explained. They lead to the observation that in reaction to the constraints that limit the program's capacity to reach its target in terms of economic development, the Auvergne territories have adapted, some by a shift towards other intervention priorities, others by a qualitative shift towards private projects with low added value."	rural areas;agricultural
152	The forest in the light of pressures of metropolitan development - The example of the Landes of Gascogne forest between the urban area of Bordeaux and Arcachon. The borders between urbanized areas and rural areas tend to fade, often because of interdependencies that develop there. This is what we found on the urbanization gap between the Bordeaux metropolitan area and Arcachon agglomeration. As part of a regional research project, we examined these relationships to understand and describe the attractiveness of rural areas. Two analysis levels relating to the dynamics of development of fringe territories were employed: strategies of urbanization through an interpretation of urban development, and the economic tools of public action on forest areas. Thus differentiated territorial strategies emerge depending on endogenous and exogenous pressures at the municipal scale level. In this paper, we propose feedbacks on the method of analysis to provide perspectives and a critical reading in understanding the mechanisms of territorial development.	rural areas;urbanized areas
153	Policy evaluation using matching: the case of the Regional Nature Parks in Auvergne and Rhône-Alpes. Amenities and their management are central to rural sustainable development issues. As a territorial policy tool, Regional Natural Parks (RNPs) have been created to protect the natural and cultural heritage as well as to build on these resources for local and regional development purposes. However, there is currently no answer –except on a case by case basis- to the question regarding the contribution of PNRs to socio-economic development of the territories concerned. This is basically a public policy evaluation question. In this context, we present matching as an evaluation method of the RNP policy. The units of analysis are the municipalities of seven RNPs in the Auvergne and Rhône-Alpes regions. The main hypothesis is that there are twin municipalities of RNP communes but located outside park boundaries. The analysis follows 3 steps: i) selection of matching and outcome variables, ii) matching of RNP with twin municipalities based on matching variables and iii) comparison of the RNP and control groups with respect to outcome variables in order to estimate average policy effects. We identify the matching method that gives the best result, and conclude that RNPs seem to have effects on the local economy, particularly in relation to tourism and local employment.	natural parks;local economy
154	"Feedback on the co-construction of a guide on territorial governance. Territorial governance has become a major issue and a central question for the implementation of public policies. As part of the partnership research program PSDR (the French acronym standing for ""research program for and on regional development""), a hybrid group composed of researchers, regional development professionals and local actors met within the Gouv.Innov project. Relying on several areas of study, this collective gradually built a definition of territorial governance as well as an analysis grid that appeared sufficiently robust to deal with the multiplicity of situations encountered in the field. A methodological guide was then co-developed for the implementation of territorial governance, primarily aimed at facilitating learning and stimulating reflexivity. This article presents the main results of this partnership research project and the perspectives prospects envisaged by emphasizing the importance of collective learning during the elaboration of the guide. We conclude with a reflection on the methods of implementation and the interest of a partnership research such as it was carried out in the Gouv.Innov project and the first concrete results."	construction;research
155	An approach associating local experts and researchers to apprehend the local agricultural dynamic of a territory. The decline of population and services in rural areas is a concern to local decision-makers. Faced with changes in policies and markets, these decision-makers do not have the diagnostic tools to estimate the combined effects of such changes in their region. They need tools to understand the effects of Common Agricultural Policy changes, taking into account local characteristics of the agricultural population and economy. This led us to develop an approach to model the effects of macroeconomic and local changes for all farms of an area over several years. Based on a typology, economic farm models and scenarios of agricultural changes, we can approximate the overall farm production of a small territory, the creation of added value and the overall income specific to each type of farm in the area, in a reference year and after a few years, for various policy scenarios and supply chain developments. The approach was developed in 2009 in a high altitude area of the French Massif Central. It gives markers to decision-makers dealing with the effects of local and international agricultural changes on their territory.	agricultural;rural areas;agricultural population;population;researchers;local agricultural;economy
156	Integration of a connectivity approach in habitat conservation planning. Landscape connectivity is considered as a key issue for biodiversity conservation and natural ecosystems stability. The state of landscape connectivity defines the degree with which the landscape facilitates or impedes movement among resource patches. Habitat modelling coupled with connectivity analysis based on graph theory provides a spatial operational approach to an integrative landscape management. The approach provides maps showing the connectivity status of different patches within the landscape matrix. The project was carried out by the Landscape ecology-modelling group working at Irstea in conjunction with naturalist experts from the National Forest Office (ONF) and Bird Protection Leagues (LPO) from the Drôme and Isère Departments (France). Two species of wild horseshoe bats were studied in the regional nature park of Vercors. The work is part of the MocHab project (“Modelling of species distribution: a tool for habitat evaluation, conservation and ecological connectivity”). The French Ministry of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy (MEDDE) financed it.	biodiversity
157	How to analyse terrestrial ecological network connectivity? A Mediterranean example. The terrestrial and aquatic ecological network in France is based on the conservation and restoration of ecological connectivity of habitats with regard to species' ecological requirements. Recent development in landscape ecology based on graph theory and species movement modelling offer promising applications in terms of landscape management and biodiversity conservation. We first present the method of potential connectivity based on graph theory and explain why it goes beyond previous approaches. Then, we illustrate with an example of a connectivity analysis in the PACA region on the Red Squirrel, a forest generalist species. The models identify the areas that are isolated from the rest of the habitat network and how connectivity varies according to species' dispersal distance. They highlight the most important patches and corridors that must be preserved as a priority in order to maintain the connectivity of the habitat network. These examples clearly show how these methods can be valuable decision support tools for the implementation of terrestrial ecological networks.	
158	The implementation of the terrestrial and aquatic ecological networks: an additional vector for the dispersal of invasive species?. The spread of exotic species favored by increasing global trade is the source of biological invasions. These invasions cause severe environmental and economic damages. The objectives of the French terrestrial and aquatic ecological network to facilitate species movement for biodiversity improvement can also promote the spread of certain invasive species. It seems necessary to consider the risk of spread of invasive introduced species in the implementation of this network.	aquatic ecological network;invasive species
159	"Field-proofing the terrestrial ecological network: representations and practices of farmers. Biodiversity has dramatically decreased these past decades, mainly because of urban sprawl and the development of intensive agriculture. In France, this topic is addressed by the ""terrestrial ecological network"" (literally in French “green belts”) measure, whose objective is to preserve or restore connectivities to allow animal or plant species to move from one habitat to another one. Different semi-natural elements localized in farming areas can contribute to terrestrial ecological networks: permanent grasslands, hedges, woods, fallows, sown grass strips, and isolated trees. The objective of this study is to understand farmers’ practices and knowledge concerning these elements and the reasons of their practices. It is based on semi-structured interviews among a sample of 20 farmers, located in the suburban context of Grenoble (Valley of Gresivaudan). The results of this work show that semi-natural elements are differently integrated in farms depending on their nature, their localization and their function and usefulness. However, the integration of these elements in farms also depends on the territorial context of the farming area as well as on how farmers consider them from a heritage, aesthetic or sentimental point of view. Combining those criteria, we identify four different profiles of farmers’ behavior concerning semi-natural elements."	agriculture;farmers
160	Paths of life: first results of an innovative project in the field of connectivity restoration. The project « Paths of life » coordinated by the Isère general council, aims at restoring the ecological connectivity of the valley of Grésivaudan located around Grenoble between the Belledonne, Chartreuse and Vercors massifs. This project (9 million €) includes several dozen actions carried out between 2008 and 2014, led by the general council, the company in charge of the motorways and others partners. The main works concern the improvement of the possibility of the fauna to cross motorways (existing passages) and departmental roads (diminution of vehicle-fauna collisions by installing a thermal detector systems). Other actions include the creation of fish passes on two rivers, the improvement of the landscape through the planting of hedges and raising the awareness of local actors. The first results of the scientific evaluation show that those actions have positive effects. The valley of Gresivaudan is subject to a strong pressure (like urbanization, infrastructures and intensive farming), which is why the restoration of the ecological connectivity depends on the improvement of the linear infrastructures but also on the whole territory (e.g. control of urbanization, restoration of agricultural area). This global management is on its way now.	agricultural
161	Freshwater ecosystem services and the implementation of aquatic ecological networks in urban areas: what are the expected impacts?. The various existing aquatic ecosystems in urban areas are nowadays considered as central parts of many urban development programmes but also in designing future sustainable cities. However, the consistently observed ecological degradation of watercourses draining urban land for decades limits the delivery of a range of ecosystem services and goods that benefit people’s well-being. In this context, the development of aquatic ecological networks in many urban areas together with projects for the ecological restoration of aquatic environments, can improve the provision of different services thanks to an ecological condition more closely resembling streams not affected by urban land use. Locally, provision and quality of regulating, supporting and cultural ecosystem services can evolve favorably. We highlight the need to consider all identified natural, artificial and “hybrid” water components of the urban hydrosytem able to contribute to the provision of services as well as the central role of ecological engineering. While the benefits of an aquatic ecological network in cities will mainly affect the local environmental quality, while facilitating an integrated water management, the recovery of a regional upstream-downstream hydrological continuum can likewise allow to limit urban effects on peripheral hydrosystems.	urban areas;freshwater
162	The river corridor: networks already in place needing strengthening and protecting - Descriptions dedicated to ecological questions with a cognitive and operational scope. The approach presented here consists in building a series of spatial indicators for the river corridor watercourse and riparian corridors) on the entire network of metropolitan France and then comparing them to functional ecological responses (e.g. biodiversity, trophy and resilience). In order to reflect the state and connectivity of habitat mosaics embedded within the corridor, these indicators measure the appropriate composition and/or configuration present within the landscape at the local and network scales. Building homogeneous indicators over the entire French hydrographic network has allowed us to investigate specific and quantitative relationships not only with regard to physicochemical responses (e.g. water quality), but also in relation to the potential spatial distribution of mammals (e.g. otters and beavers).  We describe here an analysis concerning otters in the Loire watershed. The presence of wooded riparian corridors combined with a lack of alteration of the physical environment of the watercourses offer favorable conditions for colonization by this species. Such configurations were mapped while taking into account the density of the hydrographic network. Results identify structural and functional networks which meet the ecological needs of the species at different scales. They provide effective support to guide management strategies aimed at strengthening and protecting such areas.	environment;water;mammals
163	"Effectiveness of corridors: what do we know?. The ""trame verte et bleue"" (the French terrestrial and aquatic ecological network) and all policies concerned with the preservation and restoration of ecological networks identify fragmentation as a major factor of degradation of landscapes functions. Preservation of corridors aims to restore connections between habitats for species. The concept of corridors, developed by landscape ecology research, is changed when used for ecological networks. Ecological knowledge on the role of corridors does not necessarily answer the expectations of policy makers but is consistent with a number of issues (e.g. moving species particularly to enable the adaptation to climate change, ecosystem services). The scientific contribution to the implementation of corridors reconnecting spaces previously isolated (by infrastructure) will be to propose protocols for assessing the effectiveness of construction of these corridors."	ecology
164	Monitoring of the infiltration of a planted discharge area by a continuous water quality observation system; a case study in Coutières (79). This article presents a project that seeks to better characterize the relevance of vegetated discharge areas with regard to the treatment capacity of the subsoil of the area. It aims at better understanding the respective shares of the soil and subsoil to purify wastewater and distinguish the contribution to decompose the zero discharge into evaporated, evapotranspirated and infiltrated parts. These objectives are achieved by implementing an innovative metrology, with a particular focus on monitoring the quality of the subsoil through electrical conductivity as a guide to quality of groundwater. The data record highlight the infiltration dynamics of treated wastewater, the role of vertical and horizontal circulation of groundwater in the natural treatment of the environment, and the role of the underlying groundwater depending on its low or high position. The data show the predominance of infiltration (90%), the efficiency of the purification system in the reduction of nitrate and its buffering role in case of heavy precipitation. Permeability and geological nature of the subsoil play an essential role in the dynamics of infiltration. The project site is certainly representative of a majority of cases of shallow clay subsoil.	treated wastewater;water;environment
165	The return of the whitefish: a successful ecological engineering action at lake scale (le Bourget). The large Alpine lakes provide many ecosystem services like supporting, provisioning, regulating, cultural and recreational. They are subject to many pressures, from global to local, from their watershed (e.g. nutrient flows, pollutant fluxes and demography) and internal (like fishing, water abstraction and recreational uses). Given their size, maintenance or restoration of the services is possible only through strong and long-term actions. Lake Bourget was impacted in the 1950s by high phosphorus loading, due to urban wastewater discharges associated with an increase in population and a change in the way of life, causing algal blooms and threatening the survival of fish species. Significant work was undertaken between 1974 and 1979 to bypass treated wastewater to the River Rhône and to improve wastewater treatment plants (phosphorus removal). Meanwhile, the fish stocking was carried out in the 1980s, particularly to support whitefish stocks. These actions have been successful. In terms of chemical quality, the drastic lowering of P concentrations has allowed a restoration to good quality water. With this improvement and stocking efforts, whitefish is now abundant, with a satisfactory natural reproduction.	water;lake;reproduction;whitefish;fish;alpine
166	An agroecological innovation: pesticides sequestration. For some pesticides known remediation strategies are not always feasible from a technical point of view (phytoextraction and microbial degradation) or not acceptable from a financial or ecological point of view (excavation and chemical process). Beyond extraction and degradation, pesticide sequestration in soils could be an alternative way to control further release of pollutants from contaminated soils towards other environmental compartments. Thus, the incorporation of organic matter in soils improves the sequestration of chlorodecone (kepone), an organochlorine insecticide tightly trapped in the soil. Thus, although contaminated, the soil will release the pollutant into the environment, only to a lesser extent. This method of agro-ecological management makes it possible to propose a method that is inexpensive and easy to implement because farmers master it, while waiting for effective and sustainable decontamination processes.	pesticides;environment;agroecological;farmers
167	Innovative use of soil bioengineering for erosion and sedimentation control in the Durance catchment. Soil erosion on marly terrains is a frequent problem in the mountain and Mediterranean areas in the Durance catchment in the French Southern Alps. One of the consequences of this erosion is high yields of fine sediment at the exit of catchments, which can cause economic, social and ecological damages downstream. To avoid these sediment transports, an innovative use of bioengineering techniques can be considered by letting erosion occur on slopes while retaining the eroded materials before they reach the catchment exit, therefore obtaining low sediment yields with as few interventions as possible. This can be carried out with the use of bioengineering structures within small gullies, where vegetation obstacles can play a very significant role in sustainable trapping and retention of fine sediment in gully floors. The application of such ‘low-cost’ ecological action requires establishing a specific strategy for the interventions. To do this, research has been carried out since 1998, aimed at better understanding the role of bioengineering structures and vegetation in controlling erosion and sedimentation in marly torrential catchments in a mountainous and Mediterranean climate. Results were then used to propose rules, simulations and an action plan for such a control at the scale of the Durance catchment in France.	sediment;erosion;fine sediment;soil erosion;france;soil bioengineering;alps
168	An Integrated restoration plan for the main water courses in the Haut-Rhin Departement, France. The European Water Framework Directive requires each European member to reach the good status for its water bodies. Therefore, the Haut-Rhin general council decided to initiate an integrated river restoration and management plan for its main watercourses. The restoration program aims at restoring river ecosystem functionalities. It follows an integrated approach of river basin management. The actions are based on three lines: on the one hand the hydromorphology, which aims for the re-establishment of the lateral ecological connectivity and the restoration of optimal bottom and bed diversity; on the other hand the longitudinal ecological connectivity restoration; finally the ecology, which aims to restore the riverbank vegetation and wetlands. An advanced and innovative methodology, based on an integrated and global approach, has been developed in order to define and give priority to actions in a pertinent and suitable way.	water;wetlands;river;france;ecological
169	An example of organic waste recovery: the use of ramial-chipped wood for erosion control. Ramial-chipped wood (RCW or BRF) is obtained through chipping of low diameter branches and can be used for soil enrichment. This organic waste is not as degraded as classical green compost materials but it can allow activating biological natural processes specific to wood decomposition in soil. Therefore it can improve soil quality and contribute to vegetation development. The aim of this paper is to show how it can be of interest for ecological restoration of degraded lands, especially in the context of soil erosion control. Firstly the paper describes the processes occurring during wood degradation in soil. Then the major results of experiences are summarized assessing the interest of ramial-chipped wood in the context of soil bioengineering techniques for erosion control. One of the main results is that ramial-chipped wood can stay in place for a long time (up to three years) even on steep slopes. We also sought to show how BRF could be an interesting alternative to the traditional recovery of organic waste and to wood-energy systems. Its advantage is that it offers a management method based on short supply chains that can be conceived at various levels: from local, particularly in the management of green belts, to larger-scale greening operations on large development projects.	wood;chipped wood
170	New land rules for a more agroecological land use in West Africa. In villages and rural areas of West Africa, local authorities are considering how to reform land rules to reverse the mining of land use and to promote a more productive and sustainable agriculture. By recounting the experience of drawing up the land tenure charter of Koumbia county (located in western Burkina Faso), this paper offers some thoughts on: i) the reasons and ways to combine local knowledge and farmers practices with official land rules; ii) how to involve local stakeholders in developing a land charter to ensure its legitimacy and sustainability; iii) the interest of a charter to strengthen the association of agriculture and livestock (possibly local variant of agro-ecology). This experience has taught us the following: the introduction of more environmentally friendly agricultural practices in an area depends on the recognition of rules concerning land use, inspired by the desire to preserve and maintain natural resources.	agriculture;west africa;of agriculture;mining
171	A new framework to design and evaluate cropping systems towards more sustainable orchards. To meet new challenges, innovative production systems must be developed in order to balance economic, environmental and social performances. A generic approach to design and evaluate cropping systems has been gradually developed for all crop productions. This approach can be subdivided into five interdependent steps: diagnosis of the initial situation, co-design of new cropping systems, operational implementation of innovative cropping systems, evaluation of cropping systems, and dissemination, transfer and support for producers. These steps are part of an iterative process organized around a spiral of progress to produce innovative systems, resources for action and a dynamic within a group of stakeholders sharing their knowledge and skills. Here we describe the key steps of the approach and the resources that have been produced in the fruit production chain.	orchards;new cropping
172	First assessment of the natural assets reserve of Cossure in the La Crau plain. The first French natural assets reserve was created in 2009 on the Cossure site in the La Crau plain (Bouches-du-Rhône) by the CDC Biodiversity, a subsidiary of the “Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations”, under the aegis of the French Ministry of Ecology. This operation has three objectives: (i) rehabilitate ecological connectivities with the adjacent Natural Reserve of the “Coussouls de Crau”, (ii) support the local sheep sector and (iii) test the first French compensation offer mechanism. The first ecological monitoring show that rehabilitation has allowed the creation of a favorable herbaceous plant formation, favorable to the return of the steppe avifauna but the results over the long term cannot yet be definitively predicted. The economic analysis of the experiment reveals some risks in the organization of the scheme, particularly in terms of its sustainability and the rules that govern it. The results of this experiment emphasize on the one hand the technical difficulties to rehabilitate ecosystems and on the other hand the limits of this compensation mechanism. Although this mechanism offers opportunities to improve actions to conserve natural areas, it is still important to consider the possibilities at their true value so that compensation does not ultimately replace conservation actions for biodiversity.	natural;natural areas;ecological
173	Conservation and restoration of native flora in human-transformed landscapes: what are possible approaches? . For more than 10 years, stakeholders have been using native seeds for ecological restoration at high altitude. They aim at restoring dense vegetation covers and typical high altitude pastures. Since the year 2000, the National Botanical Conservatory of the Pyrenees and Midi-Pyrenees regions and the Amidev environment agency has technically supported them, in order to initiate a restoration process in these high altitude areas following disturbance (www.ecovars.fr). We initiated studies and projects with technical stakeholders, land managers and scientists in order to choose the species that are the best adapted and technically successful and to study their ability to be harvested and propagated. The keystone of the approach is the involvement of stakeholders in the conception and the implementation of the activities. To spread these practices at a larger scale, we are strengthening a native seed production network. Therefore, we need new scientific studies both to implement new ecological restoration techniques and to assess provided ecosystem services.	environment;native flora
174	Innovation read from its organizational point of view: the example of the diversification in highland ski resorts. Forced to adapt under the effect of climate change or the changing expectations of customers towards more entertainment and wellness, the highland ski resorts have engaged since the 1990s a tourism diversification process, encouraged by regional and departmental authorities. The change of the territorial level as well as that of the players involved in tourism led to question the tourism organization of the ski resorts and the areas concerned. Our contribution will highlight the diversity of the diversification process through the analysis of proximities in three study sites, namely La Bresse, Dévoluy and the Sancy massif. Beyond this variety, we will return to the possible leverage effects for tourism diversification by offering an analysis grid for public policy	ski;highland ski;climate change
175	Land backing actions to preserve agricultural use. Urban growth around cities principally takes place on farmland, which is definitively lost for agriculture. Farmland preservation has become over these last decades a major issue for public policies, with concerns about environmental questions (water management and flood risk, ecological corridors and terrestrial and aquatic ecological networks) and about food issues. Public authorities have numerous tools to manage land use and limit urban expansion, principally based on the principle of urban planning. However, the permanent changes in urban planning allow landowners to develop strategies to enhance the value of their land rent through urbanization. At the same time, society and especially the urban world are bringing back agriculture to the public debate. As a consequence local authorities propose new dynamics regarding agricultural and environmental issues in their policies. In this context, some initiatives aiming at protecting farm use over the long term are based on public or collective acquisition of farmland. This paper gives a first analysis of this recent phenomenon we call “land backing actions”.	agricultural;farmland
176	"Supporting a multi-stakeholder dialogue process to solve water non-point pollution at a local level. Previous work of Kchouk et al. (this issue) has shown that collaboration between agricultural stakeholders, landowners and drinking water supply (abbreviated AEP in French) operators is necessary to select and implement practical solutions to non-point pollution issues, such as the implementation of artificial wetland buffer zones (abbreviated ZTHA in French). As part of a pilot project in Seine-et-Marne by IRSTEA and to deploy this type of infrastructure, an innovative support approach has been developed on the basis of developing a role-play game in order to stimulate dialogue among stakeholders. In preliminary step, the synthesis of individual interviews with local stakeholders revealed interactions between them. The process was then based on the design and testing of a role playing game that allows the link to be made between the upstream and downstream of the pollution, between the agricultural world and AEP operators, and to debate different types of solutions. Recreating the link between these two worlds and to facilitate their collaboration today is an issue that requires the appropriate tools. Different test and validation phases have been conducted with experts from the agricultural domain, researchers and members of the Technical Buffer Zones Group (led by Irstea / Onema). The extended approach helped lead to the production of a role-play game called ""Res-Eau-lutions Diffuse"". This tool is operational and generic in the sense that it addresses a problem shared by other communes like Rampillon. It can be easily adapted to other local contexts. The game is based on two complementary levers: changes in practices and management of buffer zones in the territory. Validation tests have helped to highlight the value of this approach to local actors. However, from an operational point of view, it appears that 1) the case of diffuse pollution by nitrate should be included at this stage and 2) a participatory work for re-calibrating the game with stakeholders should be carried out. This step will be required to validate and adapt the rules to their territory and make it more legitimate. This would thus increase the potential of this tool in terms of appropriation and relevance to the investigated situation. Indeed, a role-playing game is more legitimate for players who have participated in its construction because it will provide a representation of the situation and the panel of possible actions in accordance with their own mindsets."	water;agricultural
177	"Accompanying social innovation through research in a regional nature park in France: a feedback . The regional nature parks in France are often presented as "" laboratories of innovation "". Their main added value deals with social innovation, in other words the construction of territorial dynamics of collective action. Essential but much more discreet and more complex to pilot than technical innovation, social innovation is a large part of the daily work of agents, managers and elected representatives of parks. It leads to a relational dynamic and a specific identity for these territories. Taking the example of the regional nature park of Vercors, we describe the difficult conditions and the narrow path of social innovation around the construction of a shared vision by the park's joint association. A first analysis of this current dynamic allows to highlight advances, but also fragilities. These are due to the sociological and organizational components, which distinguish social from technical innovation. This gives meaning to a close partnership between the research and these «laboratories of innovation "" that are the parks. This calls for a specific attitude towards supporting public decision-makers through research that ""mirrors the action that is being carried out""."	france;research
178	"Greening civil engineering for innovation in the restoration of ecosystems: the case of the rehabilitation of an oil pipeline leak. On the 07th of August 2009, a pipeline leak occurred in the National Nature Reserve “Coussouls de Crau” in Southeastern France. It released 5 400m3 of crude oil and 8 ha of steppe type vegetation, especially rare in the European continent, was destroyed. The days following the accident revealed the lack of preparation of the conservationist land managers and ignorance of the operators concerning the heritage value of the habitat. At first, only the ""industrial"" nature of the accident was taken into account. Its impact on the natural heritage was only taken into account when a technical monitoring committee was created by the Bouches-du-Rhône prefecture. Innovative protocols for the rehabilitation of the site have been developed in the technical group dedicated to biodiversity, including representatives of the environmental administration, conservationist managers, the operator, its consultants and scientific expert. It is the constant dialogue within the group, which has allowed the acceptance of innovations by the different stakeholders. This accident will thus allow the production of original ecological engineering operations that would not have been put in place without the existence of this dialogue, the financial supports and urgency of interventions to be undertaken."	engineering;pipeline;civil engineering
179	Dynamics of collaborations between practitioners and researchers to improve flood-forecasting systems in France. Given the technical and scientific progress, one might believe that existing knowledge and data are sufficient to understand and model all the physical processes governing natural phenomena on Earth. However, providing accurate flood forecasts remains a difficult task and there is still considerable room for improvement, with social and economic stakes calling for the common efforts of scientists and practitioners. In this paper, we present the development process of a hydrological tool widely used in the French flood forecast network. The development of the model is based on two decades of research results but also on the interaction between scientists and practitioners. We describe how regular meetings and workshops favor the exchanges between researchers and practitioners and we provide two examples to illustrate concretely the active role of end-users in recent scientific developments implemented in the operational flood-forecasting tool. The promising results obtained in the everyday model use demonstrate the importance of the synergy among the actors involved for the development of innovative tools.	flood;researchers;flood forecasting;france
180	Artificial wetland buffer zones to reduce groundwater pollution by pesticides from drainage systems: an innovation in progress?. Pesticides carried off by surface runoff or tile drainage systems can be mitigated through “buffer zones” such as buffer strips and artificial wetland buffer zones. Buffer strips can be qualified as successful innovations since they progressed from an experimental stage to their adoption in the regulatory texts and by the farmers. Artificial wetlands buffer zones, still at the experimental stage in France, have required a compromise between a technical optimum and the requests of the farmers to be implemented for a first time. From an ex-post perspective for buffer strips and an ex-ante evaluation for constructed wetlands, this study analyses their transition from the concept phase to their appropriation by users. Those two devices follow each a different deployment approach but the implementation of a binding regulation, still not established for artificial wetland buffer zones, is the common denominator.	wetlands;pesticides;farmers
181	Short term planning methods for infrastructure maintenance and renovation works. The examples of three infrastructure assets, namely dams, road bridges and water networks illustrate how risk management principles can lead to various prioritization methods for annual maintenance and renovation works: « hazard analysis » of dams, the Sétra method for road bridges, and the MEDIREL method implemented for the water network in Lausanne. These methodologies are presented according to the vulnerable issues exposed to possible failures, hazard characterization, and the prioritization of actions aiming at risk mitigation in the short term.	infrastructure maintenance;water
182	Asset management: performance-based management with a view to service sustainability. From the perspective of analyzing the management practices of organizations that most often carry out public service missions, performance appears to be a common concept that guides managers in their desire to ensure long-term access to the service under optimized conditions, regardless of the type of assets to be managed. These conditions relate to the aspects and dimensions to be taken into account in defining and evaluating performance, which appears to be multifaceted: safety, technical/operational, environmental, social and economic. The article considers the possibility of defining a multidimensional performance evaluation methodology that would be independent of the type of assets analyzed with regard to their functionality and whether they are buried or visible. To this end, two case studies representative of this typology have been chosen. One considers a buried infrastructure, namely drinking water distribution systems, and the other one is visible and concerns flood protection dikes.

Based on the typology of several decision-making models encountered in infrastructure asset management, in particular for urban networks and protective structures, this article compares different models developed for decision support.

The legality control, the auditing of accounts and the control of the respect of sanitary and environmental standards, applicable to the services, do not allow to fully account for the efficiency of the service and remain insufficient to analyze its inscription in the long-term strategy that the asset management of the infrastructures supposes. It is therefore necessary to develop a regulatory system based on the publication on the Internet of technical and economic data that allows local analysis of the efficiency of the service and the relevance of its medium- and long-term technical strategies. The information system for water and wastewater services will thus play the role of a ""regulator 2.0"", by fueling the local debate between the users of the service, the operational structure, whether it is managed or delegated, and the local authority responsible for the governance of the service."	water;efficiency
186	The feasibility of relocation of properties and activities in the face of coastal risks in Lacanau. The coastline in Lacanau is intensely affected by erosion: on average, it retreats 1 meter every year, and by as much as 25 meters in the winter of 2013-2014. As part of the national call for projects on the relocation of properties and activities, the « Littoral Aquitain » public interest group and the municipality of Lacanau have jointly conducted a study to assess the feasibility of the relocation of 1194 dwellings and commercial premises. After two years of studies and the extensive work of a multidisciplinary team, major conclusions have been drawn. The case of Lacanau shows that the participation of the population in the development of a territorial project can help in finding ambitious solutions for adapting to coastal risks. The operational implementation of such a project is however hindered by the lack of means to preventively deconstruct private properties that are threatened in the short, medium or long term on the sandy coastal areas. The project ended with a number of innovative proposals to make future relocation projects possible.	relocation;coastal areas
187	Assessment of extreme values of rainfall and flood in France. Although France has extensive rainfall and hydrometric measurement systems, it is still difficult to estimate extreme rainfall or flow values over the entire territory, since observation series are often too short to provide direct information on extreme events. After an overview of the estimation methods available for flood engineering, the authors of the article present a comparative work that has enabled a better understanding of their field of application.	flood;france;rainfall
188	"Reducing the vulnerability of territories to floods: evaluating in order to act. In recent years, the flood risk management policy is shifting from an all-protection-strategy to the will to reduce the vulnerability of stakes. This change is accompanied by assessment approaches: through the work carried out for the preliminary flood risks assessment under the 2007 flood risks directive, through multi criteria analysis for protection projects, and recently through the establishment of a national vulnerability baseline. Assessing the territory vulnerability, that is to say its propensity to be affected by flooding in its various components and scales, allows to better define actions to be carried out in the different phases of risk management: knowledge and information, forecasting, urban planning, reduction of vulnerability and crisis management.
The work carried out for the vulnerability baseline allows structuring the approach to assess quantitatively and qualitatively a range of topics, and mapping them in order to facilitate decision-making. The Gennevilliers experiment shows that technical, financial and human investment can be important to have a truly exhaustive analysis.

189	"Flood management through mitigation structures distributed over the catchment area: food for thought on design and probabilistic assessment. In order to design or diagnose the operation of a set of flood prevention structures, whether large or small, it is necessary to study their operation on the scale of the watershed, and therefore to define scenarios of input (rainfall, flow) on this scale. The approach, which consists in independently defining ""single frequency"" design floods for each section of the hydrographic network studied, each representative of a flood with a given return period, is deficient when structures are introduced. Indeed, it is difficult to pass on the effect of a structure on the flow quantiles of the downstream sections. However, these probabilistic maps are necessary in order to calculate probabilistic damages, then the expected annual damages (EAD). They must also be estimated in the presence of projected structures in order to evaluate the so-called residual EAD. The difference between the reference and residual EADs represents the risk reduction to be included in a cost-benefit analysis to evaluate the project. We will describe methods to obtain these probabilistic maps in the presence of structure(s), and will present current developments. Obviously, damage reduction is only one indicator among others: protection of people, impacts on geomorphology and ecosystems to name a few. The definition of integrated strategies, multi-objective and therefore multi-criteria, therefore poses new challenges that we will only be able to touch on."	flood
190	"From public debate to the delicate implementation of an action strategy: Lessons from the ""Massif des Landes de Gascogne à l'horizon 2050"" forecasting exercise. Since the 1990s, territorial foresight has developed strongly in the wake of decentralization and the accentuation of uncertainties and risks, which weigh on territories. Yet this increased use of the foresight tool is not always exempt from ambiguity. It calls into question the intertwining between a forward-looking approach, which envisages a plurality of futures, and public policies aimed at the treatment of a short-term problem. To contribute to this debate, the article suggests returning to the foresight ""Massif des Landes de Gascogne à l’horizon 2050"", which answers a request of support for the territorial action following storm Klaus (2009) and a research agenda on options for forest adaptation to climate change. By structuring their reflection around a theory of political change, the authors highlight the advantage of a foresight approach to rethink issues, to foster public debate and to define adaptation strategies. However, the exercise conducted in the Landes de Gascogne area, where the territory tends to merge with the forest, also shows the difficulty of going beyond the scope of interventions and coalitions of established actors to implement new compromises and ways of coordination."	exercise;political

The projected climate change for the mid-21st century may have important impacts on water availability in France. The Explore 2070 foresight study, coordinated by the Ministry of Ecology, showed the necessity to quantify and anticipate these changes, and to build adaptation strategies to limit their negative consequences on hydrosystems and human activities. This article analyzes to which extent these works contributed to the awareness of water managers and to the reflection on adaptation to climate change in France.	climate change;exercise;water;france

In 2009, the Ministry for Sustainable Development launched the foresight study ""Water, Aquatic environment and sustainable territories in 2030,"" called Aqua2030. Conducted nationwide, this study had the ambition to provide a methodology for local decision-makers interested in foresight studies to develop their local policies on water and aquatic environments. It was also aimed to produce a number of recommendations to assist all levels of public decision-making in this area. Three years after the end of the Aqua2030 study, this article attempts, having briefly outlined the major objectives of this project, to present and analyze the results produced; it then attempts to determine the impact of Aqua2030 on stakeholders and on the construction of public policies at different levels of decision-making."	water
193	Foresight exercises for local water management: an experience in the Thau basin. In France, envisioning the future in the domain of water has long been the exclusive duty of state strategists and water managers. Yet since 2006, the French law for local and participatory water planning stipulates that “trends and scenarios” should be collectively built and made explicit before choosing a strategy. This article draws lessons learned from a vision building exercise implemented in 2010 in the Thau basin (Hérault, France). The authors accompanied the process and led some workshops. The article discusses what made the experience possible and successful. It argues that a specific framing fostered individual and collective exploration. It consisted in welcoming narratives and preserving participants’ individual and collective objectives. The process revealed the whole political dimension of water. Participants were able to question some choices and modes of steering.	water;france
194	Experimental network for rehabilitation of wetlands in the Finistère department . A lack of knowledge on wetland rehabilitation, and particularly on the gains of such operations on ecosystem functions, was brought up during a departmental conference on the environment, which took place in 2011 in the Finistère department (Brittany, France). To answer this lack of knowledge, the Finistère Departmental Council and the «Forum des Marais Atlantiques» initiated a collaborative experimental network on wetland restoration (Atlantic Marshes Forum). This network, based on a widespread partnership between policy makers, local managers, scientists, farmers’ associations and organisations for wildlife protection, aims to test and validate wetland restoration protocols and measure the benefits of restoration projects on ecosystem services. Five pilot sites were selected based on a call for projects. The monitoring to assess success of restoration operations focuses on functions, which support ecological services such as qualitative and quantitative regulation of water and support for biodiversity. Impact of the restoration of wetlands on farming activity is also assessed.	wetlands;environment;water;restoration

This article reviews current knowledge on the links between the social perception of wetlands and the actions and policies affecting them, in France. Firstly analyzed globally, for all types of wetlands and over time - from the Middle Ages to the present - these links between perception and actions are then questioned in terms of a particular type of restoration: that of salt marshes, through depolderisation policy. It is clear that social perception has played and still plays an essential role in the evolution of wetlands, but this role is not exclusive; it is added to other evolution factors concerning wetlands and their management, including their agricultural or recreational uses. Moreover, social representations can both promoteband hinder the management of wetlands - as the example of depolderisation clearly shows in the European countries in which it has been implemented since the 1980s."	wetlands;evolution;social
196	ASPIRE: a methodological framework for Success Assessment of Ecological Engineering or Restoration Project – Application to a high altitude wetland restoration project.. The high number of dimensions of ecological engineering and restoration projects contributes to their interest but also to the difficulty of assessing them. The objective of the ASPIRE framework is to provide a tool delivering a global project assessment while also delivering detailed scores for each of its dimensions. ASPIRE is composed of 3 levels: variables, objectives and project. The variables are measured on the study site. Their values are normalized to range between 0 and 1. The objectives correspond to a list of variables, and their score are the weighted mean of the variables composing them. The final project score is the weighted mean of the scores obtained for each objective. Scores attributed to variables are relative to references, therefore they can be compared with each other, as can the objectives and score. The weighting of variables and objectives allows highlighting different visions of the project (for instance, from various stakeholders) based on the same values measured in the field. ASPIRE is illustrated by its application on a high altitude wetland restoration project.	ecological;ecological engineering;wetland

The operation to restore the maritime character of the bay of Mont-Saint-Michel has led to the destruction of 10 hectares of reed beds sheltering protected bird populations. As a compensatory measure, the mixed association of the Mont-Saint-Michel bay, the project owner, has to carry out seven operations of rehabilitation, creation or management of reedbeds on the scale of the Natura 2000 site ""bay of Mont-Saint-Michel"". This program mobilizes a system of local actors and public institutions for the design phase, regulatory instruction, work execution and follow-up.

198	Anticipating and quantifying the possible future(s) for water management in the Durance-Verdon basin . Integrating water management models and foresight scenarios developed with the involvement of local experts and stakeholders raises numerous challenges. However, such integration can shed light on long-term challenges for sustainable water management, in particular in the context of a highly uncertain future related to climate change impact, population growth and economic development. This integration was applied within the French national research project R²D² 2050 (Risk, water Resources and sustainable Development within the Durance river basin in 2050) to assess future water availability and potential risks of unsatisfied water demands. The results of the R²D² 2050 project could help decision makers to define adaptation strategies that can support economic development while preserving the natural capital of the Durance basin. The main steps followed for developing territorial foresight scenarios are presented, along with conclusions on future balances between water availability and demand from the main water uses.	water

The new ""management of aquatic environments and flood prevention"" (GEMAPI) competence, part of the Environmental policy, establishes the coherence of actions aimed at reducing the risk of flooding and the management of aquatic environments within the scope of the EWFD (European Water Framework Directive). It opens a new perspective on the management of spaces including terrestrial. This is due to the fact that aquatic environments are the final receivers of human activity undertaken on hillslopes. In response to a question from the government at the end of 2017 on the ""implementation of the transfer of water and sanitation competencies to the communities of municipalities"", the Ministry of the Interior stressed that the management of runoff and erosion outside of sewerage systems did indeed fall within the remit of GEMAPI. In this article, we look at how flood prevention and soil erosion by runoff can be organized in the space of a small and rapidly changing watershed, through wetlands at the basin head."	flooding;wetlands;aquatic environments;interest

At the dawn of the attribution of the Gemapi (French acronym for ""management of aquatic environments and flood prevention"") competence to local authorities, it is a necessity to take into account the natural functioning of watercourses in any project of urban development and flood control. Faced with a recurrence of major floods, the Brévenne-Turdine syndicate (Syribt) had launched over the last decade a study to define a program of actions intended to restore the hydro-morphological functioning of the main watercourses of the watershed and to define priority intervention sites, including the ""Bigout"" site of 9ha in the peri-urban area of the Arbresle commune on the Brévenne River. A project management team, consisting of specialized offices in the morpho-ecological restoration of streams and bioengineering, river hydraulics, landscape enhancement of semi-natural spaces and reception of the public, was thus chosen and proposed the creation of a true ""natural park in an alluvial environment"". The studies took place over a full year in 2016. The works are scheduled for the end of 2017."	environment;flood
202	Investigating GEMAPI: which origins and which effects on local water management? . Two recent French devolution acts gave a new competence to groups of local authorities (“intercommunalités”) for the management of aquatic environments as well as for flood prevention (abbreviated GEMAPI in French). The GEMAPI competence, enforced since 1st January 2018, has been the subject of significant parliamentary and senatorial debates and an intense production of writings of all kinds. We studied the making of the GEMAPI following two objectives: first we aimed at producing a genealogy of the inclusion of GEMAPI in the MAPTAM and NOTRe acts and related regulatory documents; second we wanted to better grasp how GEMAPI actually impacts local water management and conversely. We based our analysis on parliamentary and senatorial debates records and on semi-structured interviews with actors of local water management. We show the negotiations between central, local State administration and local governments particularly on stakes such as funding, responsibility and jurisdiction exercise. Our analysis of the discourses highlights how various spoke-persons of local public action have contributed to reshape the law and regulations concerning GEMAPI. 	water;aquatic environments

204	Decision support through the application of the AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) method to the multi-criteria analysis of the development strategies for the Grand Büech at La Faurie.. The GEMAPI (Management of aquatic environments and flood prevention) competence requires managers to consider environmental and flood protection factors in their development projects. The multi-criteria analysis (MCA) method defined by the French government through the PAPI specifications (Flood prevention action programs), is similar to an extended cost-benefit analysis (CBA). In addition to conventional CBA, other environmental, human and socio-cultural criteria must be assessed. At present, project owners do not dispose of recommendations on how to prioritize, weight and possibly aggregate the different criteria in order to select a particular project. Recently, an exploratory work carried out on the Greater Buëch watershed (Hautes-Alpes), has made it possible to define a methodological framework making it possible to evaluate development projects on the basis of monetary criteria, but also on quantitative non-monetary and qualitative ones. In output, the method gives a single synthetic criterion that can support the decision. The method, which is both robust and simple in its principles, remains accessible and makes it possible to respond efficiently to the actual requirements of integrated river management. It guides managers’ choices and financial partners’ interventions on projects. 	application

With the GEMAPI competence (Management of aquatic environments and flood prevention), when looking for the best option in a project, practitioners need tools to evaluate each solution from the environmental aspect in addition to the yet mainstreamed cost-benefit and multi-criteria analyzes used for flood prevention. A recent work conducted on the Buëch River has successfully tested a method for estimating the geomorphological state of a watercourse section in its initial state and after the realization of works. The geomorphological interest of a project is thus highlighted by a simple and standard method based on solid scientific background that is additionally accessible to any classic basin agency.	flood;natural
206	Nature-based solutions for reconciling flood prevention and integrated management of aquatic lands. The application of the GEMAPI (Management of aquatic environments and flood prevention) competence in France calls for solutions aiming at reconciling flood prevention and integrated management of aquatic lands. Nature-based solutions, based on healthy, resilient, functional and diversified ecosystems to address the effects of global change, such as climate change and increase of natural risks, can be eligible for this purpose. These kinds of solution based on the use of eco- and bio-engineering structures, complementary to civil engineering ones, should allow better prevention of floods while restoring environments with an integrated approach at the catchment scale. However, the evaluation of the efficiency of this kind of solutions, in particular on flood prevention, remains a major challenge to which scientists try to answer through an interdisciplinary approach seeking to assess their ecological and security-based benefits in the framework of the GEMAPI law.	flood;flood prevention;france;nature;climate
207	Deciding in the context of GEMAPI: example of a methodology for an integrated decision support approach and its application to development projects. When considering new river management projects - and within the framework of the GEMAPI competence (management of aquatic environments and flood prevention)-, practitioners, project owners, financers and State representatives need tools to jointly assess and aggregate indicators relating to the technical efficiency in terms of flood protection (PI), environmental impacts (GEMA), but also the economic or socio-cultural consequences of the measures and strategies envisaged. An integrated and multidisciplinary approach to decision support is proposed, demonstrating complementarity with traditional sectoral concepts and tools for risk analysis (like cost-benefit analysis or deterministic risk analysis), environmental assessment and decision support. It enables both the evaluation of technical solutions at the technical and environmental levels and the co-construction of decision support frameworks shared with the various local and institutional actors. Beyond the local results, the approach and the tools proposed can be reused, adapted by other stakeholders to complement existing methods in order to help decision-making but also to trace and formalize the decision-making process.	technical efficiency

Ecological functions and ecosystem services provided by vegetation no longer need to be demonstrated. The new ""GEMAPI"" legislation makes it compulsory to reconcile management goals that may appear conflicting. The challenge lies in the conservation of healthy functional ecosystems while guaranteeing the protection of the population and infrastructures from flooding risk."	flooding

Evaluation of the regional ‘Trame verte et bleue’ (literally ""Green and blue infrastructure"", referring to the terrestrial and aquatic ecological network) policy has been made mandatory by law through the establishment of a monitoring and evaluation mechanism under the Regional Ecological Coherence Schemes (SRCE for short in French). The Ministry of the Environment has taken the initiative to set up a national working group led by Irstea to propose such a mechanism to French regions. The methodological framework developed by the group is original in its combination of public policy evaluation criteria (relevance, coherence, efficiency and effectiveness) and the DPSIR model (Drivers, Pressures, State, Impact, Response). This article first recalls the framework for monitoring and evaluating public policies. It then presents the methodological framework chosen to best accommodate the context of the ‘Trame verte et bleue’, the need to incorporate public policy evaluation criteria and the desire to produce a system organized around monitoring indicators. The DPSIR model emerges as the most appropriate in this environmental context to develop this system of indicators. The article then presents the group’s working method, its different stages and the difficulties encountered. Finally, the authors explore the prospects for the mechanism’s improvement and appropriation in a context of lack of knowledge on ecological connectivity and the strong legislative acquired by the ‘Trame verte et bleue’ with the advent of the Regional Blueprint for Sustainable Development and Territorial Equality (SRADDET)."	environment
212	"How to select surrogate species to ensure the consistency of ecological networks across political and biological levels? . Ecological networks – that should facilitate the movement of species within a landscape – are key to reconciling biodiversity conservation and land planning. These networks are, however, species-specific and one different network could be identified for each of the numerous species of a territory. To identify these networks concretely and integrate them within a broader conservation strategy, there is thus a need to select a few representative species (surrogates) that reflect the diversity of habitat and connectivity needs of the entire species pool. French political regions have already struggled with this issue when they identified their networks (in the context of the ""Green and Blue Belts"" policy). Indeed, this species selection had to rely on very limited ecological data; but disregarding this selection by using indirect methods based on land-cover and habitat data makes the validation of networks risky and communication potentially ineffective. This selection question arises again, now that regional networks have to be applied at more local scales (municipality). Here we first introduce the different approaches that exist to identify ecological networks and depict their drawbacks and advantages. Then we suggest ways to facilitate the choice of species that is consistent across different levels of governance, ensures the multiple needs of a diversity of species as well as the spatio-temporal hierarchisation of the levels of organization of living things.

This paper deals with the design and the implementation of the terrestrial and aquatic ecological network (“Trame Verte et Bleue” in French) strategy in agricultural spaces in the former Rhône-Alpes region in France. We show how the notion of “permeable spaces” along with work closely involving farmers has allowed to reduce the disagreements between agricultural and environmental stakeholders. While their original role was limited to contractualize environmental measures that were designed by others, today farmers are taking ownership of the concerns linked to ecological connectivities. They include them in all their own concerns and imagine innovative solutions to manage and preserve them in line with their activities and with the issues of their territory. 	agriculture;farmers
215	Individual use of wildlife underpasses by small mammals: what about gene flow?. Landscape fragmentation, caused by linear infrastructures answering human needs, has strong ecological consequences by genetically isolating animal populations and causing their decline. In order to reconnect populations on each side of the road, wildlife-crossing structures are built but their effectiveness on an individual scale for small mammals’ dispersion is unknown. A Capture-Mark-Recapture method has been performed on the wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus) and on the common vole (Microtus agrestis) in road verges of road sections with and without wildlife underpasses. The dispersion probability between the two sides of road sections was deduced. A partial restoration of ecologic connectivities through wildlife crossings was revealed as recaptured individuals only crossed sections equipped with wildlife underpasses. However, the dispersion probability by crossing the road may be too low to ensure a sufficient genetic flow. From a perspective of species conservation, it is necessary to enhance these structures to be more adapted to target species like small mammals and thus optimize the crossing probabilities and restore a sufficient genetic mixing between separated populations.	mammals;populations
216	Genetic monitoring as a promising tool for investigating fish habitat connectivity . With approximately 92000 obstacles to flow identified in France, restoring the connectivity of fish habitats is today one of the main challenges of public environmental policies. Although restoration priorities are clearly defined, the assessment methods for analyzing connectivity issues are not subject to any specific regulations. Different approaches can thus be adopted in order to assess the barriers to fish mobility present in a watershed. The purpose of this paper is to present the potential of molecular biology tools to address habitat fragmentation issues. Through the presentation of the foundations and principles of application of population genetics, we will see how genetic data can facilitate the understanding of connectivity mechanisms and allow the identification of blocking points on a dendritic network. We will present two case studies on brown trout, illustrating how genetic data can be used as a decision support and diagnostic tool in the implementation of connectivity restoration programs.	fish;france;population

Diagnosing the impacts of stream fragmentation on fish is crucial in order to efficiently restore ecological connectivity and to make the aquatic ecological network functional again.

A case study is presented concerning a survey of brown trout populations inhabiting fragmented small headwater streams in the Ile de France region. 	fish
218	Quantifying uncertainties in climate projections in mountain areas using statistical tools. Taking into account the uncertainties associated with climate projections is essential but often overlooked. One main reason for that is the multiplicity of climate projections representing possible future climates as a consequence of uncertainties surrounding developments for greenhouse gases, uncertainties arising from the climate models and the impact models (hydrology, biodiversity etc.), as well as the natural variability of the climate. To describe these different sources of uncertainty and take them into account is not easy for engineers and managers who are more accustomed to reasoning in a determinist framework. This article aims to demonstrate that statistics offers a number of approaches which make it possible to use a given multi-scenario, multimodel climate projection. The simplest propose a descriptive summary of the information, while the more complex approaches can test the significance of the expected changes, separate the different causes of uncertainty and measure the contribution of each to the overall variability. The approach is illustrated by a set of projections for temperature, precipitation and mean snow depth for a mountainous region of the French Alps. It can be easily applied to any variable whose projections have been generated through an impact model which simulates the consequences of a set of climate projections for a given sector defined in social and ecosystem terms.	climate

On the 30th anniversary of the Mountain Law of 1985, the Ministry in charge of territorial cohesion organized a national session of the Territories Workshop in 2016-2017, on the theme ""Living and working in mountainous area at a time of climate change"". The Territories Workshop is an approach that leads to the ""setting in motion"" of the actors of a territory to co-construct a strategic territorial project. The observation of the approach on six mountain sites (three in the Jura massif, one in the Vosges massif, one in the Alps and one in the Pyrenees) allows us to draw some lessons on the conditions favoring the adaptation of mountain territories to climate change, for example: develop trust between local actors by creating spaces for dialogue outside the institutional or procedural framework with the support of the local State, move outside the administrative boundaries to work on a territorial scale adapted to the subject under discussion, develop cooperation between territories in the same massif, begin with the needs of the territory to co-construct tailor-made solutions. Tangible results in terms of adaptation will only be visible in the longer term, when operational actions have been implemented."	climate change
220	Climate change and alpine mountain resorts: impacts and adaptation strategies. Mountain resorts today shape the economy of the territories that support them. However, global change and particularly the reduction in snow cover linked to climate change questions their future and confronts them with the need to adapt. As a result, the resorts and their stakeholders are implementing two major types of strategies: on the one hand increasing the reliability of ski areas in order to reduce their vulnerability and thus strengthen their viability, and on the other hand diversifying tourism towards a model less dependent on snow resources alone. This contribution proposes an inventory of the work and research carried out on these issues, both in France and internationally.	alpine mountain resorts;climate change;ski;mountain resorts
221	Mountain forests and climate change: impacts and adaptation. This literature review identifies the main impacts of climate change on mountain forests, mainly in Europe, and the management practices proposed for forest adaption. The rise in temperatures, more frequent droughts and the multiplication of extreme events should lead, especially below 1000m of altitude, to a decline of the least drought-tolerant tree species (spruce, Scots pine) and their replacement by deciduous trees. In addition, recruitment of some species (fir, beech) is observed at higher altitudes and the duration of the growing season is increasing. Management recommendations for forest adaptation to climate change focus on reducing tree species’ vulnerability to water stress and pests, as well as increasing their resilience and ability to respond to extreme weather events. They require genetic improvements and practices that encourage the establishment of suitable species, reduce water consumption and reduce the exposure of stands to risk.	climate change;drought;water;weather;mountain forests

This model makes it possible to move from a sectoral to an integrated and intelligent adaptation, aware of implications and synergies between several sectors of activities over a given territory. The model’s concepts are presented in UML (Unified Modeling Language), a graphical modeling language used to design computer systems. The objective is to use these concepts in order to build a web application dedicated to climate change adaptation practices, which could support governance of territorial communities. Conducted within the context of the AdaMont (2015-2017) project, this operational aim may justify the establishment of new scientific and technical partnerships.	climate change;model
224	An OLAP system for the analysis of integrated pest management data: application to the olive crop. The Agri-Food sector is facing global challenges. The first concerns feeding a world population that in 2050, according to UN projections, will reach 9.3 billion people. The second challenge is the request by consumers for high quality products obtained by more sustainable, safer and more transparent agri-food chains. The Integrated Pest Management (IPM) could be an important instrument to help farmers to face these challenges. The IPM requires the simultaneous use of different crop protection techniques for the control of pests using an ecological and economic approach. This work explores the possibility to develop a framework that combines the Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) with the IPM principles, in order to support the farmers in the decisional process, improving environmental and production performances. The proposed ICT tool is an On-Line Analytical Processing system (OLAP), which allows spatial and temporal analyses to be carried out for IPM data.	population;food;olap;farmers
225	Impact of machine robotisation on the activity of an operator. Adapting the robot to the man with whom it interacts with a view to improving working conditions and efficiency is the final objective of our work. In order to achieve this, it is essential to understand man by watching him work and interact with the robot in order to adapt the robot by modifying its interaction mode and its degree of automation. Three research questions are addressed in this article: is human activity influenced by his interaction with the robot? How does he cooperate in case of a blocking event? And is the human perception of the robot altered in these cases? 23 subjects took part in an experiment using a tracking robot in the context of a parcel picking task. Four indicators were constructed from the analysis of the subjects' activity. They quantify the operator's strategy and his cooperation with the robot. The results show that the increase of the assistant's degree of autonomy induced a modification of the leaders' strategy, that the type of cooperation used by the leader is identifiable from the analysis of his activity and that the evolution of the robot's acceptance level is linked to the degree of autonomy of the robot. The level of cooperation of a person with a robot is therefore quantifiable from the observation of his behavior. The real time adaptation of the robot to the person cooperating with it enters the domain of the feasible.	robot
226	"How to set up a farm in digital agriculture? Feedback from the ""Mas numérique"" in the south of France. The objective of this article is to present the results of a project that led to the design and development of a Mediterranean digital farm (commercial wine estate) in the South of France: Le Mas numérique. This exploitation is intended to demonstrate the technical but also functional interest of the digital solutions deployed there. Le Mas numérique has been operational for 2 years. It meets the challenges of initial and continuous training, but also of interoperability issues. The case of viticulture in the south of France is particularly interesting to address because digital technologies are being adopted by winegrowers and consulting services in the region. The aim of the article is to share this experience by presenting the collaboration that has been set up with companies, academic players and professionals. The article presents the organization of the project and the funding model that were chosen in order to design a model digital exploitation with up-to-date technologies. The proposed model is original and allows the project to be established in the long term. 15 digital services have been deployed on a winery. They have been organized on themes corresponding to practical issues (like yield and quality management as well as health protection). These areas make the digital solutions understandable to winegrowers and advisers. Specific support has been implemented for the vineyard manager and estate employees in order to facilitate the concrete adoption of digital solutions. The article presents a typology of the visitors (more than 1000 winegrowers and advisors have come to Le Mas numérique since its launch) as well as a brief description of the training and activities offered during the visits."	wine;agriculture;france;set;winegrowers
227	The design of the profession to understand the appropriation of digital technology by farmers. Given the the abundance of digital supply that promises significant benefits to the agricultural sector, sociological surveys conducted by ESA (French Higher School of Agriculture) with farmers reveal that they have not entered the digital age to any great extent. If the level of education is a discriminating variable to explain the appropriation of digital tools, it would be wrong to reduce the rejection of these innovations to a lack of knowledge. Some people refuse the integration of the digital because it is judged inconsistent with the representation that they have of their profession. Thus, direct contact and decision-making autonomy on the farm will be paramount for these farmers who will evaluate innovations in terms of their compatibility with their tastes and professional practices.	agricultural;farmers;design
228	A web platform for centralizing and analyzing digital data from the vineyard. A pioneer in precision viticulture since 2008, the Franco-American company FRUITION SCIENCES has developed a web platform, 360viti, which allows winemakers to factually analyze the impact of climate, growing conditions and terroir on the vine. The objective is to respond accurately to the physiological needs of the plant in order to produce the best quality grapes and optimize the yield of the vine. The benefits for professionals are functional, economic and environmental at the same time: 360viti offers greater decision-making security and significant timesavings in the analysis and organization of operations. The use of the platform also allows significant savings in water resources for the regions that irrigate and a controlled use of phytosanitary products and fertilizers (thanks to applications that are more targeted in space and more precise in time).	
229	The Graduate School #DigitAg, the Digital Agriculture Convergence Lab. The Human-Centered Digital Agriculture Convergence Lab #DigitAg is an ambitious multidisciplinary project focusing on the use of digital technologies to support the agricultural sector. #DigitAg considers that initial and lifelong training are keys for this numerical transition of agricultural practices; #DigitAg is therefore endowed with a Graduate School, which brings together 20 Master's degrees and executive Master's degrees related to digital agriculture. This article starts by setting the context for this Graduate School, it then describes its three main objectives: to form a community (of students), to promote multidisciplinary approaches (of teachings) and to generate opportunities (for students). The article also details some of the actions taken to achieve those objectives.	agriculture;digitag;lab

231	Linked data to facilitate the use of Plant Health Bulletins  . This article presents the archive of Plant Health Bulletins that we have published on the Web of Data. Our archive and its query system are a priori aimed at the various players in the plant sectors and they also meet agronomic research objectives on crop monitoring. The Data Web and Semantic Web technologies provide a solution for publishing structured data on the Web, not in the form of data silos isolated from each other, but by establishing the links that build a global information network. This increases the visibility and reuse of these data.	
232	The diet of the Rhone apron: a feedback of an innovative study of dietary metabarcoding. Dietary studies are essential for determining the trophic habitat requirements of a threatened species, particularly to guide its management, conservation or restoration. Within the framework of the National Action Plan for the Rhone apron (2012-2016), we have developed and used an innovative molecular method (metabarcoding) to determine and quantify the diet of the apron from its faeces. In parallel, we conducted intensive sampling of river microhabitats in order to characterize the community of potential apron prey (abundance, occurrence and physical habitats of benthic macroinvertebrates). This approach allowed us to acquire a very precise knowledge of the trophic requirements of the apron in terms of prey and habitats. It has also highlighted the decisive role played by the diversity and structure of the macroinvertebrate community on seasonal variations in the diet and condition of the apron. Our study has thus highlighted some key parameters for a better management of the carrying capacity of its habitat.	management;metabarcoding;dietary metabarcoding
233	The Rhone apron and humans along the Verdon: what possible cohabitation on this artificialized and touristic river? . The managers of the regional nature park of Verdon began to be concerned about the Rhone apron in 2008, a few years after its rediscovery by ONEMA in the Grand Canyon of Verdon. Faced with the need to manage highly visited tourist sites and to preserve its ecosystems and water resources, the managers of the Park are now conducting a coherent and concerted policy in the gorges of the Verdon in order to carry out these various approaches.	
234	Conservation of the Rhone apron: a review of the measures taken to restore the connectivity of watercourses. Since the first conservation project in 1998, river fragmentation has been identified as one of the main causes of the decline of Zingel asper, an endemic species of the Rhône river. A number of actions were started in order to restore ecological connectivity in watercourses where apron were still present. Different solutions were implemented, from the construction of fish passes to dam removal, including gate opening during floods for sediment and fish downstream migration. Population monitoring showed significant results with the expansion of the species distribution, either upstream and downstream (Ardèche), or only downstream (Durance). At 240 km at the end of the 1990’s, the range of the apron’s distribution reached 365 km in 2017. Other measures contributed to this success, such as water quality improvement, a ban on gravel exploitation in riverbeds at the end of the 1990’s and a doubling in legal minimum flows downstream of dams in 2014.  Despite this progress, socio-economic issues still limit actions identified to secure the distribution range of the species, especially given climate change risks. 	water;river;floods;zingel;climate change
235	Bocages between science and public action . The important issue of redeveloping the bocage has elicited many reactions from the public. This has led to both a research effort to understand the ecological function of hedges and the deployment of regulatory measures to control their evolution, particularly during land use planning operations. The results of the research have informed public action, and the evaluation of this action has led researchers to change their theoretical references. The advent of landscape ecology and the change of focus from hedges to the network of hedges, then to the insertion of the latter in the mosaic of cultures, has modified the ways of conceiving land use planning, and has placed the bocage in the context of other policies such as Ecophyto. Indeed, the reduction in the use of pesticides requires a good management of the beneficial insects that also use hedges. The bocage is a good example of the need for a sustained relationship between various actors and the interest of renewing scientific concepts for action.	research;evolution;hedges
236	Describe and monitor quality and quantity of hedgerows and bocages in France. Historical and cultural heritage, the bocages have been in decline for many years. The mechanization of agriculture and the abandonment of traditional methods of cultivation have led to the uprooting of a large number of hedges. However, the bocages are very favorable to biodiversity. In cultivated areas, hedges serve as a refuge for many species of flora and fauna. Their meshing also allows wild animals to move around more easily. With this in mind, National Office for Hunting and Wild Fauna (abbreviated ONCFS in French) and the National Institute for Geographic and Forestry Information (abbreviated IGN in French) have joined forces to develop a project for the qualitative and quantitative monitoring of hedges in France. This three-phase project aims to identify, characterise and qualitatively monitor bocages. The results will be a layer of the hedgerow line and a map of bocages in metropolitan France, constructed based on objective criteria linked to the type of landscape (e.g. density, connectivity of hedge). For the territories thus defined, a protocol for in situ monitoring of the ecological quality of the bocage will be set up. This project has received financial support from the ministries in charge of agriculture and ecology.	hedges;hedgerows;france;agriculture
237	Bocages and runoff apprehended through multi-agent modeling. Hydrosedimentary transfers resulting from the erosive runoff processes of agricultural soils generate multiple hazards within hydrosystems (e.g. soil erosion, water pollution and flooding at outlets). In bocages, these transfers are not rare and the landscape changes recorded over the last 70 years (like enlargement of plots and removal of hedges) tend to amplify these processes of alteration of environmental resources. Developing these agricultural areas therefore requires, first and foremost, an interest in the respective roles of the elements that comprise these landscapes (e.g. agricultural plots, hedges, ditches and ponds) and the interactions they generate with biophysical processes. The use of spatial analysis, and its modelling tools in particular, is of particular interest in this sense. After presenting a spatial simulation tool, some examples of the results obtained will be presented. The latter should enable the various managers to facilitate the implementation of adapted management plans and provide solid arguments in favour of reclaiming bocage features (like hedges, meadows and wetlands) within agricultural areas.	agricultural
238	Does surface runoff mitigation mean flood mitigation? Focus on hedges. . In a context of sustainable and integrated development, it would be desirable to limit the use of civil engineering in flood risk management and to favour solutions that are more respectful of ecosystems. However, not all authors agree on the effectiveness of actions in concerning runoff to mitigate floods. In order to apprehend these disagreements, we first present some keys to understanding runoff phenomena, which are more complex to understand and quantify than they seem, especially at the watershed scale that is appropriate for a flood prevention strategy. It appears that actions in watersheds, including planting hedges, reduce runoff to a certain intensity, and that one should be wary of generalizations. It is not a question of dismissing actions in watersheds, but rather of specifying their limits. Finally, the notion of interest or efficiency must be placed in a multi-objective context. The stakeholders have different priorities. It is up to them to define together their multi-criteria analysis methodology, as well as criteria for each of the effects like hydrological (on erosion, local or downstream flooding and water quantity and quality), heritage or environmental.	flood;flood risk;runoff
239	The Interest of buffer zones to limit water transfers of phytosanitary products: what is the possible transposition of knowledge for hedges and hedges on slopes?  . Grassed buffer zones have proven to be effective in limiting water transfers of plant protection products between the plots on which they are applied and the aquatic environment. This article outlines the processes governing this effectiveness, and examines to what extent the knowledge acquired on these devices is transposable to the case of hedges and hedges on slopes. This transposition makes it possible to integrate these landscape objects into a watershed-scale development strategy to preserve water resources, as a complement to good agricultural practices. It emerges from this analysis that the evolution of soil characteristics induced by the presence of the hedge favours a priori the retention and attenuation of these contaminants. However, further research is still necessary to characterize the rapid transfer of contaminants to the groundwater table, which may be favoured by the root system of the trees making up the hedge. 	water;hedges;agricultural;slopes;interest
240	"Does the CAP protect hedges? Multiple interpretations of the GAEC7 . In accordance with the ""good agro-environmental condition"" n° 7 (GAEC7), any beneficiary of aid from the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) has since 2015 the obligation to support the hedges present on his farm. Does this rule, unprecedented in its ambition, effectively protect them? After presenting the content of the GAEC7, the article explores the ways in which it is interpreted in the field by three main groups of actors: farmers, State services and agroforestry advisors. To do so, the provisional results of a sociological survey are called upon. They document the plurality of interpretations between and within stakeholder groups. Farmers interpret the GAEC7 negatively, which may have favoured the uprooting of hedges following the announcement of their protection. Decentralised state services apply it very differently depending on the territory, which suggests that the implementation of this national rule depends on departmental factors. The agroforestry advisors see it as a historic step forward, while regretting its punitive dimension and the negative effects of the official definition of a hedge. To conclude, this interpretative plurality is related to the global context of the CAP 2015-2020, which has been marked by major difficulties."	hedges;agricultural
241	"A bag, gloves, a garden hook: early digging out, a gentle technique against the invasion of rivers by Asian knotweed. During flood periods, the erosion of the banks invaded by Asian knotweed contributes to the spread of plants along the rivers. Indeed, vegetative fragments are uprooted, transported by the water and then deposited a little further downstream, where they can give rise to new plants. Tests have shown that these propagules are often buried under thin layers of sediment and can be easily removed with simple hand tools in the first year after dispersal. Based on these initial findings, annual walking campaigns known as ""early digging"" were set up to detect and quickly eliminate these new plants. Feedback from this management carried out along small and medium-sized fast-flowing rivers and around a lake shows that this gentle technique has the advantage of being both inexpensive and effective in slowing the spread of Asian knotweed."	flood;water
242	Cartographic analysis of plant colonization, a precious and indispensable tool for the management of the environment. . At a time when public policies are being put in place to manage plant colonization by invasive introduced species in rivers, there was a lack of tools and practical recommendations to establish action plans on the scale of a management area. The Rhone Mediterranean Corsica agency (RMC) responded to these needs at the end of 2017. It proposes a highly original method that takes into account the need to implement a coherent and effective approach on the scale of the RMC basin, while responding to the specific local features of each territory. It prioritizes the species threatening the biodiversity of watercourses and wetlands in reference lists adapted to the major types of environment and the major geographical areas of the RMC basin. It also sets a common objective for everyone: first to fight against the spread of plants, whether natural or anthropogenic, before thinking about managing areas already colonized. Finally, it proposes cartographic inventory methods and practical interpretation tools, such as the invasive stage, in order to have a common reference of invasion levels and consequently set the ambition of local action plans. 	environment;wetlands
243	The possibilities of composting Asian knotweed  . Many industrial platforms producing compost refuse organic waste from mowing or grubbing up knotweed in order to avoid marketing a product that might still contain living diaspores; there is in fact relatively little data on this risk. This risk was thus studied in a trial conducted by the Savoie department at the Grand-Chambéry platform. It consisted in massively integrating the different parts of the plant (rhizomes, seeds and stems) and studying their survival over a complete composting cycle. The results show that the process, as implemented on this platform, leads to the devitalization of the stems, seeds and rhizomes of Asian knotweed and that there is no risk of spreading the plant via the diffusion of the final compost.  These results can be extended to composts produced under the same conditions of duration, temperature rise and frequency of turnings. On the other hand, observations made during the entire production period show that composts produced in a few weeks with a single turn may contain rhizomes or seeds of Asian knotweed that are still alive.	compost
244	Control of Japanese knotweed through goat grazing in Mayenne’s wetland area, research and management aspects. In 2011, a preliminary experiment with goats (Chèvre des fossés) was carried out in a wetland with the aim of controlling Japanese knotweed. First results showed that this management led to lower biomass of Japanese knotweed. Experiments with a similar protocol were then carried out over a period of three years. As in the previous study, significant decreases were observed at any given time in Japanese knotweed cover, height of stems and dry biomass at the end of the knotweed's lifecycle. Results are more mitigated for cumulative cover of other species. They do not allow revealing benefits in terms of increasing species richness. In the grazed places, there is no increase of number of species neither within Japanese knotweed stands nor outside them. This management does not lead to a decrease in stem density at the end of the knotweed life cycle. 	goat
245	Chemical and economic valorization of Asian knotweed: what strategy for sustainable management?. Japanese knotweed, an invasive alien species (IAS), is proliferating in France and leads to many problems by impacting biodiversity, landscapes and human activities. Its rhizome is rich in molecules of interest for the cosmetics, dietary supplements and pharmaceutical sectors, presenting. It represents an interesting counterpart that would guarantee, in addition to the ecological advantages of IAS control and waste management of grubbing up sites, socio-economic interests ensuring the sustainability of such activity in a given territory. However, the strategy to be put in place must ensure that many points of caution are taken into account, in order to guarantee the harmlessness for the environment of the economic exploitation of this IAS.	environment;chemical
246	State-of-the-art bioengineering technics to control Asian knotweeds. Based on the competitive effects of native plants, bioengineering techniques aim both at controlling the development of Asian knotweeds and at restoring a diverse plant community in invaded areas. These methods are appealing to more and more managers. This article focuses on these methods, which mobilize herbaceous or ligneous species, associated sometimes with pre-treatments but always with accompanying measures. After a synthesis on the ecological mechanisms involved, some techniques specifically used to manage Asian knotweeds are described with a focus on riparian habitats. Finally the conclusion raises the question of the importance to share experiences in order to progress in the implementation of bioengineering methods to control knotweeds.	art
247	"Perception and management approaches of Asian knotweeds. Asian knotweeds are among the most widespread invasive plants in metropolitan France. As they are likely to settle in monospecific thickets eliminating any herbaceous or shrub layer in very diverse biotopes, they concern a large number of public managers and private owners. Over the years, the technical possibilities of their management have benefited from a very wide dissemination of information making it possible to regulate them in various situations. However, many managers have been faced with the need for regular interventions that need to be adapted to the local colonization context in order to allow long-term site maintenance. The achievements of research carried out in parallel on these species have contributed to changing the perception of the stakes and approaches of this management, gradually moving from a more or less systematic struggle towards a ""living with"", accepting the technical and financial limitations of interventions. As the skills they incorporate into their approaches and interventions increase, managers are increasingly involved in this ongoing collective learning that actually constitutes the management of these species."	management
248	Covering knotweed with tarps. Plant control with tarps can be an effective method to limit the expansion of invasive species (e.g. knotweed). Numerous experiments have been carried out over these past years and new geotextile fabrics have appeared on the market. However, the effectiveness of this technique is largely due to the specific methods of use, which must take into account the development capacities of the knotweed, particularly underground. The paper gives the main conditions of use and recommendations especially on covering materials, ground preparation methods and installation monitoring. We also consider the interest of these techniques regarding its cost and efficacy.	
249	Fertility and sexual reproduction of invasive Asian knotweeds in Côtes d’Armor Department. Seeds were collected from plants of the five invasive Asian knotweeds: Reynoutria japonica, R. x bohemica, R. sachalinensis, Polygonum polystachyum and Fallopia aubertii. Depending on experimental conditions, every species is able to germinate, but F. aubertii is much less fertile than the other ones. Some species germinate only in dark and cold conditions while others prefer or need light and temperature alternation. Young plants obtained from seedlings show a high morphological variability and are probably hybrids. Thus it is important to consider sexual reproduction when developing management plans.	reproduction;sexual reproduction
250	What contribution can modeling make to help manage Japanese knotweed?. This article aims to present a scientific approach based on the use of mathematical models to answer an ecological question. In a first part, we describe the general approach in modeling and present different models applied to Japanese knotweed and their relative contributions. Then, we describe the model we propose to describe the growth of a knotweed patch subjected to mowing, as well as its placement with respect to existing models. Finally, we present the types of answers that the study of this model could bring.	mathematical
251	"The impacts of Asian knotweeds on the environment and infrastructures. ""Knotweed is voracious and shows no mercy to its fellow plants. Its roots secrete substances that kill the roots of neighbouring plants. […] the density of its leaves prevents the development of the other plants because of a lack of light. In short, a true serial killer plant!"". This excerpt from an article in the newspaper Le Progrès (Lyon, 10 September 2016), accurately summarizes the public's perception of Asian knotweeds such as Japanese knotweed (Reynoutria japonica). It is not surprising that in Europe and North America, control measures against these plants are multiplying. However, is this perception based on facts? Are Asian knotweeds as harmful to the environment and public and private infrastructures as one would suspect by simply looking at the stands formed by these plants? This article details the results of an exhaustive scientific literature review on the impacts of knotweeds on the flora, fauna, soils and housing infrastructure. It shows that while some perceptions are probably true, particularly with regard to the impact of knotweed on the flora, others are based on fragile hypotheses not supported by science. The knowledge gaps are still very broad."	environment
252	The spatial and temporal dynamics of Asian knotweeds: expecting the unexpected. Asian knotweed (Reynoutria spp.) has long been of concern and fascination to many botanists and managers. Having become one of the most problematic species complexes on the planet, knotweeds present spatial and temporal dynamics with subtleties of great heuristic and practical importance. This review article proposes to establish a profile of the processes and factors underlying knotweed invasions from the scale of young plant establishment to the regional scale. Like most other invasive plants, knotweed invasion dynamics consist of a hierarchy of processes occurring based on a nested scale principle. What differs from many other plants, however, and is often ignored or underestimated, is that knotweeds are clonal plants. Thus, it appears that knotweeds probably have a much wider ecological niche than is commonly accepted. Indeed, while their seeds generally have difficulty producing new individuals in the wild, fragments of knotweed seem potentially capable of causing the invasion of most temperate terrestrial habitats, if given time to do so.	
253	"Mechanical treatment of large volumes of soil infested by Japanese knotweed rhizomes: sifting-crushing technique. In the context of the numerous operations to restore aquatic environments that it carries out, the Compagnie Nationale du Rhône (CNR) has been confronted with the lack of treatment channels for invasive introduced plants, particularly concerning large volumes of land colonized by Japanese knotweed rhizomes. Since 2011, the CNR has therefore decided to develop internally various treatment methods with the aim of immediately devitalizing the plant rhizomes in earth excavation. After two years of tests and three years of in-house application of the tested methods, the results are very satisfactory and a particularly effective technique has been proposed and deployed on large-scale restoration operations monitored by the CNR. The method in question consists of two key steps: a first sifting step to separate the fine elements from the coarse elements present in the alluvial materials; the second to devitalize the rhizomes present in the coarse fraction by fine crushing. The treated materials can thus be returned to the watercourse, valorized as planting substrate or evacuated in an inert waste storage facility (ex ""class 3 landfill"")."	
254	Contribution of remote sensing for the inventory of Japanese knotweed (Reynoutria complex) along watercourses: the example of the Azergues River. Monitoring Japanese knotweed along watercourses is an important management component for communities. Its objective is to identify the first patches of Japanese knotweed at an early stage before they spread in the environment. When they are already well established, exhaustive cartography monitoring of its propagation along the corridor is often necessary to better contain it. Remote sensing techniques have recently been proposed in the scientific literature; they would significantly reduce the costs related to its monitoring. This paper presents an evaluation of this remote sensing tool along the Azergues, a tributary of the lower Saône already heavily colonized by these plants. A detection of knotweed using IGN (acronym for the French National Institute of Geographic and Forestry Information) aerial orthophotos in the visible and infra-red was conducted and evaluated at two spatial scales: a few hundred meters of watercourse and then at the scale of the watercourse, i.e. several tens of kilometers. This analysis enabled us to identify the current advantages and limitations related to the use of this tool by scientists and managers.	
255	"Technical principles and figures of agricultural drainage - From pipes to hydro-diplomacy. This article reviews the state of the art of agricultural drainage and shows an evolution from rural engineering to remediation engineering, increasingly calling upon the disciplines of ecological engineering and territorial dialogue. Concerning remediation, solutions - necessarily complementary to a responsible use of agricultural inputs and aimed at improving the quality of drainage water - do exist and are presented in this issue. Some, such as artificial wetland buffer zones, have proven their efficiency and their recognized amenities (biodiversity, landscapes). Others, such as bioreactors or controlled drainage -applicable without investment or land consumption in our polders- require validation, or more precisely performance assessment, in our climatic context. It is therefore rather ""at the end of the pipe"" that the know-how on agricultural drainage needs to be consolidated, and in many areas. Another research issue is the place of agricultural drainage in a context of climate change, because it is necessary to know whether current structures that are known to be durable if properly taken care of should be maintained or adapted to future conditions."	agricultural;water;agricultural drainage;engineering;ecological engineering;evolution;climate
256	Anticipated and planned approaches of ecological compensation in Germany: toward a feedback for France?. The mitigation hierarchy was introduced in 1976 in the first French and German laws on nature protection. While planned and pooled compensation organizations appeared in Germany at the end of the 1990s, it was not until the beginning of 2010 in France that we observed a shift towards a more pooled (mitigation banks institutionalized in 2016 in the Biodiversity Act) and planned (recent emergence of anticipated land strategies at the regional or local level) compensation organization. However, the type of biodiversity and the implementation modalities targeted by the different modes of compensation organization differ between the two countries. In this article, we put into perspective the German and French ecological compensation systems.	biodiversity;france;germany;mitigation;ecological
257	"The mitigation hierarchy: from ecological issues to practical considerations for achieving the goal of no net loss of biodiversity. The mitigation hierarchy in France (referred to herein as AMO sequence, for Avoid - Minimize- Offset) is a widely used biodiversity conservation tool because of its attractive theoretical capacity to reconcile development and biodiversity.  In practice, the effectiveness of the AMO sequence is an unresolved quest due to e.g. the complexity of biodiversity, the numerous regulatory intertwining and the ambitious objective of achieving no net loss of biodiversity. The ""project-by-project"" approach, which remains the most widely used in France, is reaching its limits and does not make it possible to halt the erosion of biodiversity. It is therefore time to rethink the application of the AMO sequence to ensure it can effectively achieve an absence of net loss of biodiversity. We propose to start again from the ecological stakes underlying the application of the AMO sequence to show the relevance of organizing it at the territorial level. We will detail the questions that this new organization implies through a few major issues."	biodiversity;mitigation
258	The mitigation hierarchy in French regional nature parks: a territory for projects or a territorial project? . This article presents an analysis of the application of the mitigation hierarchy in France (referred to herein as AMO sequence, for Avoid - Minimize- Offset) in regional nature parks. It is the result of a survey of avoidance on the scale of several parks including the regional nature park “Boucles de la Seine Normande”, the latter having integrated the AMO sequence in its core strategic charter. The regional nature parks are regularly solicited to provide support and feedback on environmental impact studies. Due to the difficulties faced by the territory’s stakeholders when applying the AMO sequence, the challenge for the regional nature parks is to bring forth their know-how and in-depth knowledge of the territory in order to include this sequence in a broader territorial project.	france;mitigation
259	What are the effects of urban dynamics on ecological dynamics? Integrating the challenges of the mitigation hierarchy into land use planning using modeling; application to the Occitanie region. . The significant development of the mitigation hierarchy in France has not necessarily been followed by a good application, which has encountered many practical difficulties. The lack of vision and territorial coordination is often blamed for this. Anticipated land use planning seems crucial to better consider the challenges of the mitigation hierarchy. Various initiatives led by different actors are gradually emerging in this direction in France. In this context, the Occitanie region wished to adopt a regional strategy for the application of the mitigation hierarchy. The objective of this research is to support public decision-makers in determining land use change processes, mainly urban dynamics, in order to assess their impacts on biodiversity. The originality of this work lies in the analysis of the combined effects of ecological and urban dynamics in different types of development scenarios that consume more or less space. A prospective modeling and simulation approach applied to the Montpellier Méditerranée Métropole study area has enabled us to emphasize the importance of decisions regarding planning policy choices and biodiversity conservation. Beyond this research, the questions raised open up broader fields of reflection on desirable and possible modes of development in a context of global change.	france;mitigation;urban
260	Manifesto for a « KAMOA » sequence at a territorial level: initiatives for action.. Among the main points of criticism regarding the mitigation hierarchy (referred to herein as AMO sequence), its prioritization (avoidance first, then minimization and offset last) is often questioned. Applied at a project scale, the triptych might concentrate most of the action around minimization and offset without attesting to its effectiveness. As a result, avoidance measures are usually marginalized and offsets may be ephemeral and far from the no-net-loss objectives established in 2016 by the French law for the recovery of biodiversity, nature and landscapes. In order to rebalance the mitigation hierarchy, we propose to step back on the spatial and temporal aspects to include it in a broader process based on the knowledge of a territory and support for the planned actions. This KAMOA sequence (for Know - Avoid - Minimize- Offset- Accompany) suggests redistributing the undertaken efforts to better define the avoidance step and to make sure that the ecological impact of offsets are consistent within an ecocomplex. We will illustrate, through two examples, the way in which different actors in a territory (an offset operator and a project holder) can be involved in this approach and the benefits that they can expect from it. 	
261	What involvement of the agriculture sector in ecological compensation? Toward territorial approaches. Getting farmers and other rural stakeholders actively engaged in biodiversity offsetting requires to assess the compatibility of biodiversity offset goals with the management practices that farmers are actually willing to carry out on their land. We describe the impediments to enrolling farmers as offset providers and assess innovations available to overcome them. Finally, we propose another perspective that considers the transitional role, at the territorial level, that collective ecological and agricultural compensation could play to accompany the agro-ecological transition. 	agriculture;farmers
262	Preventing the risk of forest fires. Mediterranean and mountain forests have been subject to wildfire for millennia. Fire is thus a risk for forests and for people, but it is also a natural disturbance necessary for the maintenance of certain forest ecosystems. Climatic changes associated with changes in landscapes, afforestation, urban development and infrastructures are leading to an increase in the area exposed to forest fires, a lengthening of the fire-prone season and to an increase in major fires or fires with extreme behaviour. Silvicultural and territorial strategies are essential to mitigate the effects of these developments in the long term and in a sustainable manner, and to make forests more resilient and more resistant to fire. This article presents and discusses different strategies for mitigating forest fires and their impacts that have been developed over the last decades in Europe. Adaptive forest management on a territorial scale is the best guarantee to reduce forest fires and their impacts in the long term in the current context of climate and landscape changes.	fire;wildfire;forests
263	Lidar remote sensing for the management of mountain forest territories . A large part of the French forest resources is located in mountain regions. Increasing timber harvest would contribute to maintain economic activities in rural areas while providing additional renewable resources, but it is hampered by the complexity of forest stands and topography. Airborne lidar is a remote sensing technique that has been in constant expansion for the last twenty years. It is able to model the 3D structure of forests as well as topography, based on the scanning of the terrestrial surface with laser pulses emitted at high frequency. When associated to field data, forest features (growing stock, accessibility) of interest to managers and users can be mapped at high resolution over areas the size of a regional nature park. This information allows the planning and implementation of forest sustainable management actions, aiming at fostering wood production while ensuring the provision of other ecosystem service. However, the widespread use of this tool raises questions about the availability of still costly acquisitions and the conditions for disseminating innovative tools and results to stakeholders in the sector.	rural areas
264	Adapting management to meet the climate challenge: the example of the Mediterranean forest . Mediterranean forests are particularly vulnerable to climate change and associated disturbances such as drought and wildfire. Management is an effective means of adapting forests to these changes in particular by strengthening their resilience. In this article we will discuss three management approaches: i) natural regeneration which requires intervention because it is often difficult to achieve (we take the example of mature Aleppo pine forests and oak coppice, ii) the role of thinning, which allows for the selection of individuals and an improvement in the water balance of stands iii) and finally, the role of mixing which has numerous effects on biodiversity, growth, vulnerability to pathogens or even resilience after fire. The adaptation of Mediterranean forests to environmental change requires more active management with shared objectives for their future.	climate change;drought
265	Climate warming: can French forests provide solutions between now and 2050?. The carbon balance of the forest is based on three well-known pillars: sequestration in the forest, storage in wood products and substitution of energy or products that emit more carbon. This last pillar is often misunderstood because it is the effect furthest removed from physical measurements and statistical inventories. It is estimated by using generic substitution coefficients that exclude the evolution of stocks in the forest, without specifying the reference scenario, which is not always consistent with the scenarios in which the coefficients are used. Two recent studies on the carbon balance of French forests agree that the carbon debt contracted when harvesting is increased takes at least 35 years to be repaid through substitution, in the best case scenario. The inclusion of the forest compartment in order to arrive at aggregated substitution coefficients for the entire sector therefore generally leads to their being revised downwards, or even reversed, and highlights the sector's mitigation levers. The increase in sequestration in the forestry sector is therefore based on the orientation of wood towards uses where substitution is most effective or on the identification of particular forestry situations where laisser-faire has a negative carbon balance, and not on a massive increase in harvesting.	climate warming;wood;carbon
266	Managing forests to meet climate objectives: trade-offs to be made. Highlighted at the COP21 in Paris in 2015 for its capacity to absorb carbon from the atmosphere, sustainable forest management is considered as a means of slowing global warming. A study published in October 2018 in the journal Nature simulated different forest management scenarios in Europe, taking into account both carbon sequestration and the biophysical effects of forests on the climate to estimate the contribution of European forest management to achieving the objectives of the Paris Agreement. This study shows that managing European forests to maximise their carbon sink would not affect the climate, contrary to the expectations of the Paris Agreement, and that such a strategy would imply a considerable reduction in wood production.	global warming;climate;europe
267	Water quality and ecotoxicology in the Rampillon Artificial Wetland Buffer Zones – Seine-et-Marne (77). Non-point source pollution generated by the intensification of agricultural practices leads to disturbances in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. This article is part of the PSDR Brie'Eau project (2016-2020) aimed at sharing ecosystem services for regulating pollutant flows and maintaining biodiversity in the context of field crops in the Seine et Marne department (France - 77). In order to prevent the degradation of the aquatic ecosystem, in parallel with actions targeting agricultural practices, ecological engineering actions are set up to manage agricultural waters that are variably charged with pollutants. This is the case of the Artificial Wetland Buffer Zone (Zone Tampon Humide Artificielle, ZTHA), system that promotes natural chemical and biological reactions to improve water quality. In 2010, a pilot ZTHA was set up in the commune of Rampillon near the “Ru des Gouffres” watercourse. It is located upstream of the direct inflow of surface water to the Champigny aquifer, which supplies part of the Ile de France region with drinking water. Within the ZTHA, the INRAE and AQUI'Brie association collaborate on monitoring to measure its effects on water quality. The results speak in favour of the project, since it significantly reduces the frequency with which the drinking water threshold, set at 50 mg/L of nitrates, is exceeded. Similarly, the ZTHA promotes the abatement of metal and pesticide flows at the outlet. Notwithstanding this abatement, laboratory ecotoxicological studies show that pesticide exposure at levels as measured in the ZTHA are likely to induce sublethal impacts in ecological organisms that are key to the functioning of aquatic ecosystems; these require confirmation in situ. In conclusion, this work confirms the relevance of these artificial ecosystems for the improvement of water chemical quality and the need to reduce upstream inputs of agricultural contaminants for optimal protection of aquatic life. Additional work is nevertheless essential to assess the ecotoxicological impact on the trophic chain that develops within the ZTHA. This article is the first in a trilogy presenting the various assets of the ZTHA to address current environmental issues such as water quality, biodiversity and land use planning.	water;france;pesticide;natural chemical;agricultural
268	Biodiversity and ecosystem services in the Rampillon Artificial Wetland Buffer Zones – Seine-et-Marne (77). Artificialisation of land and intensification of agricultural practices have led to the homogenization of landscapes and decline of biodiversity. In fact, the loss of diversity of natural or semi-natural habitats leads to a decrease in species richness in many areas. Among various actions to address these challenges, ecological engineering contributes to restore ecosystem functions and services by relying on nature-based solutions. This is the case of the Artificial Wetland Buffer Zone (in French Zone Tampon Humide Artificielle, ZTHA) whose primary function is to improve the quality of water in an agricultural drainage context. However, it turns out that this tool also promotes habitat diversity in the context of field crops that have undergone major land development to optimize agricultural productivity. In order to assess the impact of ZTHAs on biodiversity at the Rampillon experimental site, inventories on 7 taxa (Amphibians, Chiroptera, Lepidoptera, Mammals, Odonata, Birds and Reptiles) were carried out in 2017, seven years after their construction. As a result, over an area of about 1 hectare it is possible to find more than 40% of the species among the taxa of Amphibians, Odonates and Birds known in Île-de-France. The ZTHAs also promote terrestrial and aquatic ecological networks on a territory that has become homogenous through successive land consolidation, by diversifying the landscape and promoting connectivity between natural elements (role of relay space). In addition, pedagogical and recreational aspects are added to the overall benefit with the installation of an educational trail on the study site. The issues mentioned above stimulate ecosystem services and are pooled on one land site: the ZTHA. Ultimately, their deployment on a larger scale is proposed, which will contribute to the ecological development of territories and allow agroecosystems to have a reduced environmental footprint. This article is the second in a trilogy presenting the different strengths of ZTHAs to face current environmental issues.	france;artificial
269	"Mutualising territorial issues in the context of field crops - INSPA: a GIS tool coupling hydrology and ecology.. For many years, the land has undergone land use planning aimed at promoting agricultural productivity, sometimes to the detriment of the environment, particularly in the context of field crops. Aquatic environments have been degraded, resulting in a decline in water quality and loss of ecological habitats. To apply the regulations related to the Water Framework Directive and achieve the objectives of good status, actions must be undertaken. It is within this context that the Brie'EAU research project fits in, which among several ecological engineering actions or, more broadly, nature-based solutions (abbreviated SFN in French), develops the concept of Artificial Wetland Buffer Zone (ZTHA). These ZTHAs help improve water quality, maintain or even strengthen local biodiversity, contribute to the terrestrial and aquatic ecological network and diversify the agricultural landscape. Initial studies have shown that ZTHAs address these environmental issues and thus guarantee various ecosystem services. A spatial analysis tool, INSPA (French acronym for INsertion SPAtiale or ""SPatial INsertion"") allows proposing sites for new ZTHAs by conciliating the hydrological and ecological functions of a territory. The multi-criteria geomatic analysis is therefore based on the combination of hydrological and ecological layers characterized with buffer distances. The tool makes it possible to adapt these distances according to the priority issues of a territory in order to serve as a tool for spatial and temporal planning."	water;agricultural;environment
270	Benthic microbial communities as diagnostic tools to assess the impact of micropollutant contamination on ecological and functional quality of watercourses. Over the last decades, anthropic activities have led to the degradation of aquatic ecosystems worldwide. In Europe, the Water Framework Directive aims to protect aquatic ecosystems, in particular by implementing biomonitoring programmes to evaluate their ecological and chemical quality. Nevertheless, current biomonitoring programmes present numerous shortcomings in particular considering the complexity of environmental exposure to contaminants (e.g. multicontamination, temporal variability of concentrations) as well as the various biological responses to contaminants (e.g. standard toxicity tests based on little ecologically-relevant species, mixture effects not taken into account). In this context, the present article describes the state of knowledge concerning the contribution of benthic microbial communities to the evaluation of the ecotoxicological and functional quality of watercourses exposed to micropollutants. Various microbial indicators helpful for the diagnosis of both the exposure to and the effects of micropollutants are described, like diatom morphological alterations, microbial adaptation and acquisition of tolerance and organic matter decomposition rates. The advantages and disadvantages of the application of these diagnosis tools in environmental management are then discussed, highlighting the limits to be overcome before their implementation, such as the lack of standardized protocols and general references or the need to better acknowledge the relevance of microbial communities in aquatic ecosystems.	benthic microbial
271	Dam removal – insights from the American context . The implementation of the policy of restoring the ecological connectivity of watercourses is nowadays conflictual in France, with numerous oppositions from mill owners, hydro-electricity companies and local residents. In particular, they denounce a dogmatic application of regulations (European water Framework Directive; the French law on water and aquatic environments; The French Grenelle environmental initiative). At the same time, the United States are often held up as a model in terms of dam removal, even though little is known about the concrete implementation of these operations. The article therefore proposes to detail the modalities of dam removal projects in the USA in order to participate in discussions that will help to calm the situation in France. Several elements are highlighted: the absence of binding regulations, whether at federal or state level, a necessarily multi-partner funding of projects based on a call for projects logic and a consideration of asset issues. These differences with the French context are studied through the analysis of a dam removal on the Musconetcong River (New Jersey). The conclusion underlines the collective dimension of the projects in the USA, offering a lower potential for conflict and reviews the contributions to the French context of this analysis.	france;water
272	Why and how to preserve natural olfactory landscapes?. Living organisms and decaying organic matter release a wide variety of organic compounds into the atmosphere, creating olfactory landscapes from which organisms draw the information essential to their survival. Nowadays human activities (especially urban areas, transport, industry and agriculture) also generate many volatile organic compounds in the atmosphere. These mask and degrade natural odors and alter the olfaction of living organisms. This results in anthropogenic modifications of the odor landscapes that affect the functioning of the ecosystems. This raises questions about the necessity and possibilities of protecting natural olfactory landscapes. Agroecological techniques in particular have shown that it is possible to manipulate odors, even on a landscape scale. The preservation and restoration of a landscape free of anthropogenic odors could then be considered in order to preserve the integrity of ecologically important odors in contiguous spaces. This is a vast project and we encourage further reflection on how to take better account of odors in the protection of biodiversity.	odor;areas
273	Which species should be used for bioengineering in the West Indies? . In the West Indies, erosion and landslides are common. In order to meet societal needs in terms of prevention against the risks of erosion, it is necessary to stabilize riverbanks and slopes of gullies. To achieve this objective, bioengineering offers more environmentally respectful solutions than traditional civil-engineering techniques. There are few bioengineering experiments in tropical America, particularly in the West Indies. The main recommendations are based on the use of exotic species even though this biodiversity hotspot harbors a diverse native flora, which can offer relevant possibilities for soil bioengineering and participate in the restoration of riparian ecosystems.  This article presents a bibliographic review of bioengineering experiments carried out in the West Indies and more broadly in tropical America. It proposes a method aiming to identify relevant native riparian species suitable to control the erosion of riverbanks and to evaluate their multiplication modality for use in bioengineering. The first results concerning an experiment with cuttings of 31 species are presented and confirm their potential of participating in the development of bioengineering in the West Indies.	west indies;bioengineering

275	Participating is also learning! . Learning is an important effect of participatory approaches. In social interaction, everyone acquires new knowledge, know-how or skills, whether they are participants, coaches or sponsors. However, in practice, these achievements are rarely evaluated. What is it all about and how do we go about it? We propose a two-part approach: conceptual framing elements and concrete examples in the field.	
276	Planning sewerage systems with stakeholders by integrating expert technical knowledge: challenges of modeling and transfer of WasteWAG in Senegal. WasteWAG is a role-play and participatory planning tool for individual and collective sewerage systems in urban and rural areas in Senegal. It has been modeled collectively by Irstea engineers and stakeholders involved on the ground (like NGOs, neighborhood committees and technicians) based on the Wat A Game method and more broadly on the principles of modeling support. Apart from being the result of a shared representation of the reality of sewerage systems in Senegal, the particularity of WasteWAG lies in its modeling process oriented on: (1) the training of stakeholders involved on the ground (future facilitators of the tool) in a transfer perspective, (2) the integration of expert technical knowledge on sanitation processes in the tool, (3) the multifunctionality of WasteWAG (awareness, planning, simulation). The objective of the article is to give an account of the singularity of this modeling approach contributing to make technical knowledge available to the stakeholders involved on the ground.	senegal;sewerage
277	Territorial facilitation, a profession to be developed and defended: feedback on a large-scale approach in Tunisia. This article analyzes the relevance of a new profession, that of territorial facilitator. Territorial facilitators are generally in charge of facilitating the dialogue between different types of actors (like farmers, elected officials and the administration) for the development of a defined area. This article describes a pilot scheme that trained and accompanied Tunisian agricultural administration agents, in charge of supporting rural development, in the learning and implementation of their new profession with a view to concerted territorial planning in 6 Tunisian rural areas. The job of territorial facilitator is based on the acquisition of three types of skills: theoretical knowledge (accessible knowledge), know-how (experience and practice) and life skills (attitude and values). This implies going beyond the standard and conventional technical knowledge of these agents to build a composite expertise. The article describes the skills acquired by Tunisian facilitators based on their testimony. They report on the evolution of their attitude, more benevolent towards rural populations, and capacity for understanding, analysis and adaptability to different intervention situations that takes into account the different points of view of the participants. This experiment, carried out within the context of the PACTE program, shows the interest of this profession for territorial development in Tunisia. Territorial facilitators have thus led a series of workshops and meetings with a total of more than 4000 participants (i.e. one sixth of the population of the six intervention zones). The article concludes on the challenges to be met for the extension of the experiment to other regions in Tunisia and elsewhere.	tunisia;agricultural;tunisian rural areas;populations

281	Shared water policy in New Caledonia:  Feedback on a system of policy co-construction and co-planning . In March 2019, the Government of New Caledonia approved the framework for the country's first water policy. This policy, called the Shared Water Policy is the result of a broad consultation involving about 1 in 600 New Caledonians. Launched a year earlier, this consultation resulted in a document of nearly 200 pages that sets six strategic objectives and proposes 700 actions to be implemented. This article presents a retrospective of the consultation mechanism set up for the development of this policy. It focuses in particular on the proceedings of the process and on the planning support tools that were used, partly inspired by the co-planning mechanism, called COOPLAN (Co-construction and Co-planning of an action plan for water management). We analyze the feedback from participants and facilitators and discuss the limitations of the tools.  	water;of
282	"Efficience et optimisation de l'irrigation : le modèle Optirrig. ""Irrigation optimization"" takes on a different meaning and requires different methods as new constraints appear (water quotas, periods of limited availability, prefectural decrees, increased water and energy costs) while the same contradictory targets remain: ensure maximal financial profit and sufficient crop yield from controlled cumulative irrigation. The inclusion of irrigation efficiency amid optimization targets seem both a virtuous process and an additional constraint, as the most efficient strategies (maximal ratios of ""transpired irrigation"" on total irrigation) which also are the most productive strategies (""more crop per drop"") are often not those responsible for maximal crop yield. The latter typically require more irrigation, hence the need for a trade-off, with or without a reward for the adoption of efficient and deficit irrigation. The Optirrig model for the generation, analysis and optimization of irrigation scenarios (i.e., chronicles) is a plot-scale crop model and water management tool that compares the merits of different irrigation strategies (i.e., decision rules). Couplings are possible with spatially-distributed modelling tools to address larger scales. This paper is proposes a conceptual approach on how to deal with irrigation efficiency in irrigation optimization issues, in particular with Optirrig."	irrigation;water;irrigation efficiency
283	Review of methods to assess vine water status. Assessment of vine water status is crucial to optimize cultural practices and irrigation strategies to guarantee an environmentally and economically sustainable viticulture in view of increasing water shortages caused by global warming. Vine water status can be assessed by indirect, soil-based or atmospheric-based methods or by direct plant-based methods, each having different benefits and drawbacks depending on the application. This brief review aims to provide a perspective on the recent and most important findings in the literature dealing with direct plant-based methods. Recent scientific advances regarding hydraulic and stomatal regulation in vines highlight the limitations of traditional techniques such as leaf water potential measurement, particularly in the context of drought and high vapor pressure deficit (VPD). 	water;irrigation;drought;global warming;methods

While in France, the law supporting Engagement National pour l’Environnement» (""on the National Committment for the Environment"", 2010) has legally recognized the tool called ""Trame verte et bleue"" (referring to the terrestrial and aquatic ecological network), in Italy, the ""reti ecologiche"" have not yet been the subject of any national legislation. Whereas the French regional planning experiments (Schéma régional de cohérence écologique) are carried out within a framework defined by the Environmental and Urban Land-Use Planning Codes, in Italy, regions have experimented more freely: some have opted for a normative or design approach to ecological networks, while others have used landscape planning (related to the application of the 2004 «Codice dei Beni Culturali e del Paesaggio») to preserve or restore ecological connectivity. The article focuses on two case studies, the French and Italian ones, with an emphasis on regional experiences on the one hand (Piedmont and Auvergne Rhône-Alpes), and on their translation into supra-local and local planning (Provincial Territorial coordination Plan and Regulatory Plan in Italy, Territorial Coherence Scheme and Local Urban Plan in France) on the other hand."	environment;ecological
285	"The densification of low-density areas in the Canton of Geneva (Switzerland): a lever to strengthen ecological networks? . In Geneva, the low-density housing area occupies nearly 40 % of the canton's building areas, but accommodates only about 12 % of the population. Under the impetus of federal and cantonal public policies, a more rational use of land is recommended. Building areas must therefore be densified to accommodate urban development, thus avoiding encroachment on the agricultural zone. With this in mind, the Canton of Geneva amended its legislation concerning these areas in 2013, allowing significantly higher densities than before. This has indeed allowed an increase in the number of housing units, but often to the detriment of the environmental, ecological and landscape quality of these residential districts, which are often richly wooded. Municipalities have however the possibility of defining a framework for this development by setting out a ""strategy for the development of the low-density area” in their municipal master plan. The article illustrates the measures deployed to accommodate urban densification, while not only preserving biological connectivities, but also reconstituting them where they have disappeared. Within this framework, the densification of the low-density area thus becomes a lever to reconstitute landscape and biological networks where they do not exist anymore or are threatened by diffuse urbanization.

286	Participatory observations to better characterize floods, water resources, and their impacts. . Facing changes in climate, land occupation, use and water management strategies, socio-hydrosystems are evolving towards trajectories that sometimes break with those of the past: water shortages in some basins engendering social tensions or crises, extreme events generating violent and devastating runoffs or floods and paralyzing the social and economic organization of large cities around the world. Observing the processes that operate on socio-hydrosystems or the impacts of the changes they undergo is essential for a better understanding of their characteristics or anticipating their evolution. These observations are no longer the sole concern of professionals; citizens can prove to be particularly useful to the system by contributing to the improvement of scientific knowledge and in return can themselves benefit from scientific or social recognition. Thus participatory observatories can help to answer scientific questions and societal and environmental issues.  Three examples of participatory hydrological observatories led by teams of researchers are presented to illustrate our remarks: an international and interdisciplinary field school in the Mediterranean region, a hydrometeorological, participatory and low-cost observatory in a tropical climate and an observation system for the impacts of floods in the Mediterranean climate	floods;water;climate
